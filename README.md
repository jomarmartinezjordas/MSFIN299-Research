This study explores the application of sentiment analysis, specifically utilizing the FinBERT transformer model, in assessing the sentiment expressed by company management in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of annual reports of Philippine listed companies. The study aims to investigate whether the sentiment scores extracted from the MD&A section are related to abnormal returns surrounding the release of the annual reports. The implementation of FinBERT on the annual reports demonstrates the effectiveness of modern NLP techniques in quantifying management sentiment. However, the findings indicate that while sentiment scores can be derived from the MD&A section, they do not provide a distinct advantage for financial decision-making or stock trading. Specifically, the sentiment derived from new information does not have a significant relationship with subsequent trading prices in the short window after the release of annual reports. This study also aims to contribute to the Philippine financial and accounting research by employing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for textual analysis of Philippine financial literature.
