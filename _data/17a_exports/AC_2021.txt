and record-high fee income.

• ACEN’s net income increased 22 percent to ₱5.3 billion as robust earnings from its international assets supported softness in Philippine operations.
• Excluding gains and other one-offs, Ayala’s core net income decreased 10 percent to ₱23.5 billion, mainly driven by weaker net interest income in BPI, higher depreciation expense in Globe, and reduced stake in ACEN following the completion of its capital market issuances and sale of secondary shares to GIC combined with higher financing cost taken up at the AC Energy parent level.

Ayala’s net income grew 46 percent to ₱8.4 billion in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in the previous year, also driven by the abovementioned realized gains.

Sale of goods and rendering services increased 17 percent to ₱225.6 billion mainly due to higher residential bookings, incremental project completion, and construction services in Ayala Land, better operation across all sites in IMI, higher vehicle sales in AC Motors on the back of looser quarantine restrictions, and higher revenues in AC Energy from the consolidation of Islasol and Sacasol, and the consolidation of Qualimed into AC Health.

ACEN’s net income increased 22 percent to ₱5.3 billion as robust earnings from its international assets supported softness in Philippine operations.
• Equity earnings from international plants soared 51 percent to ₱4.9 billion, driven by operating capacity with the commencement of operations of new wind farms in Vietnam and solar farms in India.
• Earnings contribution from its Philippine plants decreased 20 percent to ₱3.1 billion as the start of operations of the Palauig and Alaminos solar farms was outweighed by increased cost of purchased power due to higher spot market prices. Without one-off retroactive feed-in tariff adjustment booked in 2020, earnings from the Philippine assets would have been flat.
• ACEN’s attributable output increased 21 percent to 4.6 gigawatt hours, driven by higher operating capacity and increased dispatch of thermal plants.

Decrease mainly due to impact of CREATE law (see Note 25).
Operations of the segment under PFRS 5 – 119% decrease from net income of ₱9,797 million to net loss of ₱1,814 million
Includes the net income after tax of MWC less consolidation adjustments. Decrease mainly due to lower billed volume and remeasurement loss. In addition to the remeasurement loss taken up in years 2019 and 2020, an amount of ₱3.1 billion was recognized for the period ending June 3, 2021, which formed part of the GAE of operations of the segment under PFRS 5 (Note 24).
Income attributable to owners of the parent – 62% increase from ₱17,142 million to ₱27,774 million
Increase coming from better results of most of the investees plus the AC Energy’s gain on disposal and remeasurement gain in GNPK and AC’s gain on retained interest of MWC, as mentioned above. As a percentage to total net income, this account is at 77% and 59% in December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Income attributable to non-controlling interests – 32% decrease from ₱12,129 million to ₱8,262 million
Decrease coming from share in the remeasurement loss in MWC partly offset by share in net income results of non-wholly owned subsidiaries. As a percentage to total net income, this account is at 23% and 41% in December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

2021 continued to be a challenging year for the Philippines as the COVID-19 pandemic widened its spread. Quarantine measures throughout the year fluctuated with the rise and fall of daily infections, affecting the flow of mobility, business operations, and social activity. Despite the volatility, enterprises and individuals alike grew more accustomed to such circumstances, resulting in a generally more stable and predictable economic environment over the year. This was helped in large part by an improvement in vaccination rates when the government’s inoculation program kicked off in March. By the end of the year, over half of the Philippine population was vaccinated.
The improvement in the country’s health response and inoculation rate was evident in economic growth. GDP grew by 5.6% last year, reversing from a 9.6% decline in 2020 despite the higher number of COVID cases in 2021. As both individuals and enterprises adopted to the consequences of the pandemic, mobility improved and so did business stability. By the final quarter of the year, mobility levels in the country returned to their pre-pandemic levels and GDP growth was at 7.7%. That said, we acknowledge the pervading risks, perhaps foremost of which is the present conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We are keenly monitoring its impact and are watchful of how this could affect the momentum of recovery, particularly in the form of rising oil prices, its effect on interest rates, exchange rates, and inflation, and ultimately, disposable income and consumption. The BPI Global Market team categorized its outlook into central, moderate, and adverse scenarios that correspond to the average WTI oil price per barrel at US$75, US$100, and US$115. Depending on the average price at year-end, it expects a real GDP growth for 2022 of 7.3%, 5.7%, and 4.6%, respectively.
A trend we have seen strengthen throughout the year is the adoption of digitalization. Both consumers and businesses have turned to digital channels to improve business continuity amidst restricted mobility. While quarantine measures have eased, we have seen a stickiness in the use of digital channels, which we expect to continue. Enterprises are focusing their efforts on driving activity to the digital front as digital adoption has become ingrained in consumer behavior.
Another notable area of strength in 2021 was remittances which remained robust despite the infection surges experienced throughout the year; the annual tally hit an all-time high of US$34.1 billion. On a related note, we see the USD/PHP rate breaching the ₱52.8 level in 2022 as imports recover with improving consumption on a central case scenario. BPI Global Markets expects this to move up to ₱53.7 and ₱54.5 for moderate and adverse cases, respectively.With support to businesses critical at this point, the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas has kept interest rates at their record low of 2.00%. However, as economic conditions improve and to temper inflation, BPI Global Markets expects three rate hikes coming in this year in a central scenario, bringing interest rate to 2.75%. However, it anticipates bigger rate hikes following moderate and adverse scenarios, which correspond to year-end rates to be at 3.25% and 3.50%, respectively. Alongside this, it sees a percentage point cut to the required reserve ratio, bringing the figure to 11% from the current 12%.
In this light, Ayala has budgeted a total of ₱285 billion in capital expenditures this year, 25% higher than what was deployed in 2021. With guarded optimism, we hope that looser quarantine restriction today will help boost our path towards recovery, but at the same time are cognizant of the risks that the current geopolitical landscape, particularly the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may bring.
Ayala maintains a healthy balance sheet with access to various funding options to meet requirements. A robust risk management system allows the company to maximize opportunities for reinvention, and navigate the challenges faced by its business units.
