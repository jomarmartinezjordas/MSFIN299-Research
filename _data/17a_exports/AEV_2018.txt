The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Aboitiz Equity Ventures, Inc. (AEV or the “Company” or the "Parent Company") and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures set forth elsewhere in this report.

In 2018, the Company’s KPI evidenced its strong operating performance and financial stability. Profitability was sustained and financial position remained strong and liquid.
With the fresh contributions during 2018 from the newly operating plants of Pagbilao Energy Corporation (PEC) an Hedcor Bukidnon, Inc. (Hedcor Bukidnon), as well as from the newly acquired feeds business of Gold Coin Managemen Holdings Limited (GCMH), consolidated EBITDA increased by 6.5% during the year. Meanwhile, Associates and Join Ventures (JV) continued to generate substantial earnings and enhance the consolidated bottomline despite the 15% decline in their income contribution to the Group.
Consolidated EBITDA translated into substantial cash inflows coming from Subsidiaries' operations and from dividen payments of Associates and JVs. Internally-generated funds were then used to partially finance capital expenditures, settle maturing financial obligations, and pay cash dividends.
With equity growing more than debt during 2018, debt-to-equity ratio declined slightly to 1.55x (versus end- 2017's 1.56x). Simultaneously, current ratio improved to 1.76x (versus end-2017's 1.61x) as the growth in current asset outpaced the growth of current liabilities.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, AEV and its Subsidiaries posted a consolidated net income of ₱22.23 bn, a 3% year-on-year (YoY) increase. This translated to earnings per share of ₱3.95 for the year in review. In terms of income contribution, the Power Group accounted for 73%, followed by the Banking and Financial Services, Food, Real Estate, and Infrastructure Groups at 16%, 7%, 3%, and 1%, respectively.
In 2018, the Group generated non-recurring losses of ₱891 mn (versus ₱2.30 bn of non-recurring losses in 2017), consisting of net unrealized forex losses and asset impairment costs. Stripping out these one-off items, the Group’s core net income for the year amounted to ₱23.12 bn, 3% lower YoY. AEV recorded a 6.5% increase in consolidated EBITDA, from ₱56.98 bn in 2017 to ₱60.66 bn in 2018.

Aboitiz Power Corporation (AP) ended 2018 with an income contribution of ₱16.69 bn, a 6% increase from the previous year's ₱15.70 bn. Netting out unrealized forex losses and impairment costs recognized during the year, AP's contribution to the Group's core net income increased by 2% YoY, from ₱17.95 bn in 2017 to ₱18.31 bn in 2018.
With the fresh income contributions during 2018 from PEC and Hedcor Bukidnon, the Power Generation and Retail Supply Groups’ bottomline contribution to AEV increased by 12% from ₱13.71 bn in 2017 to ₱15.35 bn in 2018. Adjusted for non-recurring items, Generation and Retail Supply Groups’ core net income contribution remained flat during 2018 at ₱16.1 bn.
Capacity sold for the year was flat YoY, from 3,167 megawatts (MW) in 2017 to 3,152 MW in 2018.
Power Distribution Group's earnings contribution to AEV decreased by 5% YoY from ₱3.29 bn in 2017 to ₱3.12 bn in 2018. Stripping out impairment costs, its recurring earnings contribution grew 6% YoY from ₱3.18 bn in 2017 to ₱3.36 bn in 2018. This increase was mainly attributable to electricity sales, which increased by 5% YoY to 5,540 gigawatthours (GWh). This was a result of increased consumption across all customer segments.

Income contribution from this industry group decreased by 13% YoY, from ₱4.12 bn in 2017 to ₱3.58 bn in 2018.
On a stand-alone basis, Union Bank of the Philippines (UBP) and its Subsidiaries recorded a net income of ₱7.32 bn for 2018, down 13% compared to the ₱8.40 bn earned in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower income contribution from CitySavings Bank, which recorded lower loan releases to teachers.

Income contribution from the Food Group (Philippine-based Pilmico Foods Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and foreign-based Pilmico International Pte. Ltd. and its Subsidiaries which include the Gold Coin Group) decreased by 8% to ₱1.56 bn in 2018, compared to ₱1.70 bn in 2017. On a recurring basis, during 2018 Feeds Philippines and Farms showed a decrease in income contributions while Pilmico International reported an increase. Feeds Philippines’ 38% YoY decline in net income was due to increased raw materials costs, which negatively affected profit margins. Farms' net income decreased 15% YoY due to lower biological asset revaluation gains. These decreases were partly offset by the growth in Pilmico International's net earnings, primarily due to the fresh income contribution of GCMH – an expansion in one of Pilmico’s core feed milling businesses - which mitigated the effects of higher input costs to Pilmico International’s animal and aqua feeds businesses.

Income contribution of Aboitiz Land, Inc. (AboitizLand) for 2018 amounted to ₱645 mn, down 13% from ₱744 mn in 2017. This decrease was due to the absence during 2018 of fair valuation gains on investment properties.

Republic Cement and Building Materials, Inc.'s (Republic) income contribution to AEV decreased by 68%, from ₱671 mn in 2017 to ₱213 mn in 2018. This was mainly due to significantly higher fuel and power costs, which offset the improvement in sales volume and prices attributable to government infrastructure spending and stable private sector demand.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, consolidated net income allocable to the equity holders of AEV registered a 3% YoY increase to ₱22.23 bn, compared to ₱21.61 bn in 2017.
Operating profit for 2018 amounted to ₱39.16 bn, a 7% increase YoY, as the ₱36.52 bn increase in revenues during the period surpassed the ₱33.94 bn rise in costs and expenses. This increase was mainly attributed to the performance of the Power Group.
Power Subsidiaries reported a 7% YoY increase in operating profit, from ₱34.17 bn to ₱36.50 bn, mainly due to the fresh earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) contribution from PEC and Hedcor Bukidnon.
Share in net earnings of Associates and JVs declined by 15% YoY (₱7.73 bn in 2018 compared to ₱9.05 bn in 2017) due to the decrease in income contributions from the following: (i) SN Aboitiz Power-Magat (SNAP-Magat) and SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet (SNAP-Benguet), resulting from lower hydrology in 2018 as compared to the higher- than-usual hydrology levels in 2017; (ii) UBP, largely attributable to the lower 2018 net earnings of one of its subsidiaries, CitySaving Bank; and (iii) Republic, owing to significantly higher fuel and power costs in 2018.
The growth in operating profit and other income offset the decrease in equity earnings and higher interest expense, and as a result, which resulted in an increase to the Group's overall profitability. Net interest expense increased by ₱1.42 bn, or 12% YoY, due to the higher average debt level in 2018.
Other income increased during 2018 to ₱1.41 bn, from ₱26 mn other expense in 2017. This improvement was mainly due to the Power Group's collection of settlements with suppliers in 2018 (vs nil in 2017) and higher impairment costs in 2017, which were partly offset by higher foreign exchange losses in 2018.
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (NCI) increased to ₱9.01 bn in 2018 from ₱7.67 bn in 2017, substantially due to the increase in consolidated net income of AP and the recognition of the NIAT share of GCMH's minority shareholders.
AEV's consolidated comprehensive income attributable to equity holders increased by 3% YoY, from ₱22.56 bn in 2017 to ₱23.24 bn in 2018. The 3% increase in consolidated net income accounted for majority of this increase.

Compared to year-end 2017 level, consolidated assets increased 13% to ₱554.59 bn as of December 31, 2018, due to the following:
a. Trade and other receivables, inclusive of noncurrent portion, increased by 50% (₱37.24 bn in 2018 vs ₱24.77 bn as of December 31, 2017) mainly due to the first-time consolidation of GCMH's ₱3.93 bn accounts receivable, and the higher level of the Power Group's receivables resulting from the take-up of PSALM deferred adjustments in the books of Davao Light & Power Co., Inc. (DLP) and Visayan Electric Co., Inc. (VECO). The recorded receivables represent PSALM deferred adjustments (Generation Rate Adjustment Mechanism and Incremental Currency Exchange Rate Adjustment) that are to be recovered from customers or to be collected from PSALM.
b. Inventories and Land and Improvements increased by 51% (₱24.44 bn in 2018 vs ₱16.14 bn as of December 31, 2017). The P9.32 bn rise in Inventories was mainly due to the following: (i) first-time consolidation of GCMH's ₱5.74 bn inventory; (ii) higher raw materials and real property inventories of the Food Group and Real Estate Group, respectively; and (iii) higher coal inventory of the Power Group. This increase was partly offset by the ₱1.35 bn decline in Land and Improvement resulting from the reclassification of lots to be developed from Land and Improvements to Real Estate Inventory.
c. Gross of depreciation expense, the ₱19.66 bn combined growth in Property Plant and Equipment (PPE), Property Held for Sale and Investment Properties (IP) in 2018 was mainly due to the following: (i) ₱4.86 bn on-going construction of AP's power plants; (ii) ₱8.94 bn various capex of Power, Food and Real Estate groups; (iii) ₱4.78 bn first-time consolidation of GCMH PPE; and (iv) ₱1.0 bn upward translation adjustment by power subsidiaries using US Dollar as functional currency and fair valuation gains on investment properties. Property Held for Sale (₱676 mn in 2018 vs nil in 2017) refers to transmission assets that will be transferred and sold to the NGCP in the next 12 months, and have been reclassified from PPE.
d. Investments in and Advances to Associates and JVs increased by 17% (₱106.96 bn in 2018 vs ₱91.61 bn as of December 31, 2017) mainly due to: (i) the ₱5.38 bn additional acquisition of UBP shares; (ii) AP's ₱2.50 bn capital infusion into GN Power Dinginin Ltd. Co. (GNPD); (iii) ₱3.33 bn reversal of share of mark-to-market (MTM) losses on AFS investments of an associate; (iv) ₱924 mn share of retained earnings adjustment of an associate resulting from the adoption of PFRS 9; (v) ₱464 mn share of associates' cumulative translation adjustments; and (vi) recording of ₱7.73 bn share in net earnings of associates and JVs. This increase was partially offset by the ₱5.14 bn cash dividends received from associates and JVs during the period.
e. Intangible Asset - service concession right increased by 24% (₱3.79 bn in 2018 vs ₱3.06 bn as of December 31, 2017) mainly due to capitalized repairs done during the year.
f. Other Current Assets (OCA) rose by 44% (₱17.99 bn in 2081 vs ₱12.44 bn as of December 31, 2017) mainly due to: (i) Therma South, Inc.'s ₱2.65 bn increase in restricted cash representing the cash reserve to be maintained in compliance with the covenants of its project debt; and (ii) Therma Visayas, Inc.'s ₱1.72 bn advances receivable from NGCP related to the construction of a transmission line.
g. Debt Investments at Amortized Cost, formerly classified as Held-to-Maturity Investments, increased to ₱454 mn in 2018 from ₱189 mn as of December 31, 2017. This was mainly due to additional acquisitions made of this type of financial product during the year.
h. Deferred Income Tax Assets increased by 52% (₱2.32 bn in 2018 vs ₱1.53 bn as of December 31, 2017), mainly due to the corresponding deferred tax benefits recognized on the unrealized forex losses and asset impairment provision recorded by the Power Group during the year.
i. Goodwill increased by 36% (₱56.26 bn in 2018 vs ₱41.31 bn as of December 31, 2017) due to the new ₱15.52 bn goodwill generated following the acquisition of GCMH during the year, which was partly offset by the deconsolidation of the ₱524 mn goodwill resulting from the disposal of PETNET.

The above increases were tempered by the following decreases:
a. Cash & Cash Equivalents decreased by 9% (₱59.03 bn as of end- 2018 vs ₱64.87 bn as of end-2017) as the funds used in investment acquisitions and repayment of maturing obligations exceeded the funds generated from operations and long-term loan availment.
b. Derivative Assets, net of Derivative Liabilities (current and non-current) decreased by 55% (₱131 mn in 2018 vs ₱294 mn as of December 31, 2017) mainly due to MTM losses recognized on existing swap and forward contracts of the Power Group.
c. Investments in Financial Assets at Fair Value to Profit or Loss (FVTPL) and at FV to Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), formerly classified as Available-for-sale (AFS) Investments, decreased by 25% (₱579 mn as of end-2018 vs ₱773 mn as of December 31, 2017) mainly due to disposals made during 2018.

Consolidated short-term bank loans increased by 14% (₱26.98 bn as of end- 2018 vs ₱23.70 bn as of December 31, 2017) mainly due to the first-time consolidation of GCMH's ₱2.35 bn in bank loans and the ₱7.31 bn in loanavailments of the Power and Real Estate Groups, which were partly offset by ₱6.26 bn loan repayment made by Food Group.
Long-term debt likewise increased by 8% (₱258.54 bn as of end- 2018 vs ₱238.54 bn as of December 31, 2017) substantially due to the following: (i) AEV International's availment of a ₱11.79 bn loan; (ii) AP's retail bond issuance of ₱10.2 bn; (iii) GMCP's availment of a ₱9.04 bn loan; (iv) a total of ₱6.20 bn in loan availments by other Power Group companies; (v) first-time consolidation of GCMH's ₱2.37 bn loan; and (vi) a ₱4.54 bn non- cash upward movement due to amortization of deferred financing costs and forex differential. These increases were partly offset by the prepayment by Therma Power, Inc. (TPI) of its ₱15.10 bn loan, the ₱6.70 bn settlement of maturing loans, and a ₱2.33 bn decrease in finance lease obligation due to amortizations paid.
Trade and other payables, inclusive of non-current portion, increased by 51% during the year, from ₱25.42 bn as of end-2017 to ₱38.42 bn as of end-2018, mainly due to the first-time consolidation of GCMH's ₱9.13 bn trade payables and the take-up of the PSALM deferred adjustments at DLP and VECO. The recorded payables represent PSALM deferred adjustments (Generation Rate Adjustment Mechanism and Incremental Currency Exchange Rate Adjustment) that are to be remitted to PSALM or refunded to customers.
Income tax payable decreased by 24%, from ₱703 mn in 2017 to ₱535 mn in 2018, mainly due to lower income tax liability of the Power Group for the year.
Asset retirement obligation (ARO) increased by 24% from P2.96 bn in 2017 to P3.68 bn in 2018 due to the upward revaluation adjustment recognized during the year on this future obligation.
Pension liability, net of pension asset, increased by 47%, from ₱223 mn in 2017 to ₱328 mn in 2018, mainly due to the decline in the fair value of the investment in traded equity securities owned by the retirement fund of the Company. This was attributable to the decline in market prices of these securities at the end of 2018.
Deferred Income Tax Liabilities (DTL) increased by 48% (₱2.39 bn as of end- 2018 vs ₱1.62 bn as of December 31, 2017) mainly due to the first-time consolidation of GMCH’s ₱600 mn DTL.

Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent increased by 13% from the year-end 2017 level of ₱154.70 bn to ₱174.71 bn as of end-2018 mainly due to: (i) the ₱22.23 bn net income recorded during the year; (ii) the ₱3.33 bn reversal of share of MTM losses on AFS investments of UBP; (iii) the ₱903 mn increase in cumulative translation adjustment; and (iv) the ₱497 mn retained earnings adjustment related to first-time adoption of PFRS 9 and 15. These increases were partly offset by the ₱7.21 bn in cash dividends paid during 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Group continued to support its liquidity mainly from cash generated from operations, additional loans availed and dividends received from associates.
Compared to the cash inflow in 2017, consolidated cash generated from operating activities in 2018 increased by ₱6.18 bn to ₱38.42 bn in 2018, mainly due to the growth in earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization (EBIDA), and was partly offset by higher working capital requirements.
As of end-2018, ₱30.76 bn was recorded as net cash used in investing activities versus ₱11.30 bn from 2017. This was mainly due to the acquisition of GCMH and higher cash disbursed on additional investments in associates.
Net cash used in financing activities was ₱13.22 bn in 2018 versus ₱19.46 bn in 2017. The decrease was largely attributed to the higher net bank borrowings in 2018 (₱18.82 bn vs ₱7.85 bn in 2017), which was partly offset by higher interest payments and dividends paid to minority shareholders during the year.
For the year in review, net cash outflows surpassed cash inflows, resulting in a 9% decrease in cash and cash equivalents from ₱64.87 bn as of year-end 2017 to ₱59.03 bn as of December 31, 2018.

Financial ratios remained healthy. Current ratio improved from year-end 2017’s 1.61x to 1.76x at the end of 2018 as the growth in current assets outpaced the increase in current liabilities. Debt-to-equity ratio likewise improved from year-end 2017’s 1.56:1.to 1.55:1 at the end of 2018.

Based on information provided by UnionBank’s Economic Research Unit, in 2019 AEV expects the Philippines to record a GDP growth rate of 6.8% due to election spending, and public and private construction, supported by strong and continuing public expenditure on various infrastructure development projects. AEV believes that it, together with its Strategic Business Units (SBUs), is in a position to take advantage of opportunities emerging from a growing Philippine economy and will continue to sustain the growth of its SBUs over the long-term.

AboitizPower is focused on addressing the needs of its markets, namely: (1) reliable supply, at a (2) reasonable cost, and with (3) minimal impact on the environment and communities. The Company believes that no single technology that can completely address the country’s energy requirements and that a mix of power generation technologies is necessary to address the country’s needs. Thus, AboitizPower continues to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies, where and when it makes sense.
Despite increased competition in the power generation market, the Company is confident that it has built the foundation to sustain long term growth, as seen in its pipeline of new projects (see Item 1 Section 2a(i) on Generation of Electricity on page 7 where target commercial operation dates for each project are discussed per business unit). The Company is also currently on track with its target to reach 4,000 MW net attributable capacity by 2020.
AboitizPower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. Its sound financial condition is expected to give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.
The Company expects that its existing distribution utilities will continue to realize modest growth. It continuously seeks efficiency and improvements in its distribution utilities’ operations in order to maintain healthy margins.
AboitizPower has alloted over ₱50 bn for capital expenditures in 2019, about 80% of which is for thermal projects, and the remaining balance allocated mainly for exploratory and operating activities.
Other known trends, events, uncertainties which may have material impact on the Registrant have been discussed in previous sections of the report (e.g., for an extensive discussion on regulatory issues, see Section (xi) on Effects of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on the Business on page 99).

With its goal of becoming one of the top three universal banks in the Philippines, UnionBank continues to implement its 10-year business transformation roadmap called FOCUS 2020. In order to achieve its goal, the Bank measures progress in terms of metrics relating to financial value to stakeholders, operational excellence, customer franchise/share of wallet, unique customer experience, and delivering superior and innovative products and services, rather than traditional metrics such as asset size or branch network.
Now that the Bank is at the tail-end of its FOCUS 2020 strategic plan, the shift towards a recurring income business model has become more evident. The Bank shows progress towards its objective of becoming one of the country’s leading retail bank, which the Bank believes requires it to increase its core earning asset base, attain a balanced source of revenue, and shift towards a recurring income business model as it fortifies its balance sheet. Most of the Bank’s revenues are already recurring in nature since 2013 at 71% in 2013 to a high of 99% in 2017 and 94% in 2018. Likewise, the retail segment accounts for a significant portion of the Bank’s revenues, averaging 50% of total revenues in the past five years.
UnionBank will continue to leverage its core strengths to drive its performance. In order to provide stable returns and predictability in the growth of shareholder value, the Bank utilizes its capital as it shifts from trading to building recurring income. To cater to changing customer expectations, it focuses on transforming its branches and building the competence of its sales force, rather than on expanding its brick-and-mortar network. It strengthens corporate relationships by providing innovative cash management solutions to anchor clients. The Bank focuses on process improvement, specifically in building the foundation of the Bank’s automation and digital transformation initiatives. It builds synergies with its partners in order to expand customer reach, products, and services. It leverages on having a unique UnionBank DNA, focused on building the right culture and organizational capabilities. Lastly, the Bank leverages on its subsidiaries, such as City Savings Bank (CitySavings), as an avenue to expand reach towards the underserved segment for inclusive prosperity.
UnionBank is also embarking on its Dual Transformation Strategy in order to improve its current and future competitive advantages. This strategy is composed of the following:
i. Transformation A, through which the Bank will be repositioned as a Digital Bank. This requires the application of the latest technologies to UnionBank’s core banking systems to in response to changing customer demands. The Bank also intends to use advanced technologies to move into adjacent markets and become a leading Mass Market Bank. The Bank’s goal does not solely revolve around acquiring mass market-focused institutions to widen scope in key segments, but in using technology to improve operational efficiencies and ramp up scale towards achieving its goal of inclusive prosperity; and
ii. Transformation B, through which the Bank will seek new business models of the future. The goal is to immerse the Bank in emerging technologies (such as the blockchain and the token economy) that may disrupt the banking industry. UnionBank intends to bank on, enable, and invest in fintechs in order to e embed financial technology into its customer services platforms. The Bank’s goal is to make its services indispensable in a rapidly evolving financial services environment, where banking is not simply transactional but also part of an embedded customer experience.
UnionBank has alloted ₱2 bn for capital expenditures in 2019.

Pilmico, AEV’s non-listed multinational food subsidiary, is an integrated food and agribusiness company based in the Philippines. Its businesses include flour milling, feed milling (with operations in the Philippines and Vietnam), livestock farming, and commodities trading. Pilmico remains one of the Philippines’ top flour, feeds, and farm players, with a strong track record and nationwide reach. Pilmico is also one of the largest aqua feed millers in the Mekong Delta in South Vietnam, and exports flour throughout the ASEAN region.
In July 2018, Pilmico International acquired a 75% equity stake in GCMH, the parent company of the Gold Coin Group, one of Asia’s largest privately-owned agribusiness corporations. The Gold Coin Group is a major producer of animal feeds, operating 20 livestock and aqua feed mills across seven Asian countries, including South China. It also enjoys lead market positions in key Asian markets, and is well-recognized and respected in the regions where it operates. The Gold Coin Group focuses on feed quality and consistency, thus enabling it to maintain long-term loyalty of its clients.
Together with the Gold Coin Group, Pilmico International is set to become a comprehensive Animal Nutrition platform across the ASEAN region, backed by strong competitive advantage in delivering scientifically balanced livestock, aqua feeds, and specialty animal nutrition.
The acquisition of GCMH has effectively expanded Pilmico and the Aboitiz Group’s footprint in the ASEAN region and across the Asia-Pacific market. Growth in the coming years is expected to be driven by a combination of project developments (capacity expansions) and strategic acquisitions.
The Flour business will employ a two-pronged market strategy of: (i) maximizing growth potential in the Visayas region and Mindanao island, while (ii) building and developing new channels in Luzon through continuous sales efforts. The business likewise intends to moves forward in the value chain as it continues selling value-added flour products (noodles) and potentially expanding into a more diversified product portfolio.
The Farms business is progressing towards a sow-level of 36,000 heads by 2025, supported by a focus on farm expansion and supplemented by contract farming. The expected increase in volume opens up opportunities for the business to increase its market share. This will entail unlocking more distribution channels and achieving forward integration in the value chain (meat fabrication and processing). Meanwhile, the layers business intends to expand to eventually house 1.3 mn ready-to-lay hens. This expected surge in layers capacity (8x from 2018 levels) will result in a monthly production of 27 mn eggs by 2025.
Feeds Philippines continues to strengthen its market position with additional capacity expansions programmed up to 2025. New expansions of feedmill plants is expected to double volume in the next six years. Strategic geographical and product positioning will be key to acquiring and retaining customers in a more competitive market. Furthermore, investments in warehouse and logistics are intended to provide operational agility and improve customer experience.
Likewise, Aqua Feeds Vietnam is expected to gradually step forward to serve emerging opportunities for fingerling feeds in the region. This planned product diversification will be supported by an additional fingerling line in the existing facility. The aqua business proves to be a lucrative industry in Vietnam. Forward integration (fish processing) is likewise planned to take advantage of the increasing farm-gate prices of fish, such as Pangasius, in the market.
On the other hand, the Gold Coin Group has set forth a robust project pipeline with its growth-focus countries: China and Vietnam.
For China, plans involve expansion of Dongguan Mills with a new Fish and Hog line facility. The current growth and demand in Southern China has already filled up the existing Dongguan capacities. The same is true with Zhangzhou, the easternmost mill in China, which will require a new pelleting line to meet the strong demand. The automation of the finished goods packing lines, which is expected to break ground in the first half of 2019, is expected to improve efficiencies and lower labor costs in China operations.
For Vietnam, both expansion and business integration activities are planned for 2019. The development of Ha Nam Fish Feed line in North Vietnam is expected to be operational by the end of 2019. Moreover, from successfully integrating Pilmico’s Animal Feeds Vietnam into GoldCoin Vietnam in early 2019, the integration of Pilmico’s Aqua Feeds operation is being considered in order to fully integrate Vietnam operations.
2019 will be a fresh start to a new multinational Food Group. Together with the Gold Coin Group, Pilmico is surrounded with many opportunities to advance business and communities locally and abroad. The business will leverage on people development and digital transformation in order to achieve its goals to deliver solutions to customers and differentiate against competitors. Through an agile workforce enabled by technology and operational excellence, the Food Group is confident that it is well-positioned to capitalize on market volatility and deliver its brand promise of being a customer’s partner for growth.
Pilmico has allotted ₱6 bn for capital expenditures in 2019.

AIC remains committed to participating in the Philippine infrastructure space and contributing to the nation’s development.
AIC is a member of the NAIA Consortium, which was granted Original Proponent Status by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) for its unsolicited proposal on September 10, 2018. The consortium looks forward to being able to provide the much-needed upgrades to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) and complement government to enhance the overall passenger experience and improve operational efficiency as the nation’s primary gateway. AIC, together with the other members of the consortium, will continue to work with government through the next steps in the process of getting approval from the National Economic Development Authority, in accordance with RA 6957 also known as the BOT law.
Similar to NAIA, AIC was also granted Original Proponent Status by the DOTr for its unsolicited proposal to operate and maintain the new Bohol-Panglao International Airport (BPIA) on September 3, 2018. This new international airport located in the island of Panglao has significant growth prospects given Bohol’s strong tourism potential, especially with the international market. As per the DOTr, the airport is expected to commence operations this year with a capacity of approximately 2 mn passengers.
On August 10, 2018, AIC also submitted an unsolicited proposal for the operations, maintenance, and expansion of the Laguindingan Airport in Misamis Oriental, which is the gateway to the Northern Mindanao Development Corridor (NMDC).
On February 26, 2019, AIC was granted Original Proponent Status by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines for its unsolicited proposal on Laguindingan Airport. The ₱42.7 bn project involves capacity augmentation through expansion or construction of new passenger terminals, installation of required equipment, and enhancement and development of airside facilities.
These airport projects are aligned with AIC’s objective to support regional development centers outside of Manila.
On August 13, 2018, a consortium comprised of AIC, Unisys Philippines, and AC Infrastructure Holdings Corporation submitted an unsolicited proposal under the BOT Law to the Philippine Statistics Authority for the design and development of a National Identity Infrastructure solution, which is intended to collect, store, maintain, manage, and authenticate identity information of individuals.
