The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of AEV and its Subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures set forth elsewhere in this report.

Equity earnings in investees increased by 91% from ₱9.0 billion (bn) during 2020 to ₱17.2 bn during 2021. The increase was due to: (i) commissioning revenue from GNPD Unit 1, (ii) higher output of SN Aboitiz Power-Magat, Inc.'s and SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet, Inc.'s hydro power plants resulting from higher water inflows, (iii) higher earnings of UnionBank, (iv) recognition of income from liquidated damages for delays in the construction of GNPD’s power plant, and (v) higher earnings of RCBM due to stronger demand, increased overall efficiency, and tax adjustments resulting from the CREATE Act.
Consolidated EBITDA translates into substantial cash inflows from the Subsidiaries' operations. These inflows, coupled with dividends received from Associates and Joint Ventures are the main source of internally-generated funds, which are then used to finance capital expenditures, additional investments into Associates, dividends and debt service payments.
With equity increasing more than total liabilities during the 12 months of 2021, Debt-to-Equity ratio as of December 31, 2021 decreased to 1.2x from end-2020's 1.7x. Current Ratio as of December 31, 2021 (compared to end-2020's 1.6x) increased to 2.3x mainly due to higher cash balances.

For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2021, AEV and its Subsidiaries posted a net income attributable to the equity holders of parent Company (“Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV”) of ₱27.3 bn, a 77% increase YoY. This translated to earnings per share of ₱4.85 for the period in review. The Power Group accounted for the bulk of the income contributions to AEV at 57%, followed by the Banking and Financial Services, Real Estate, Food, and Infrastructure Groups at 23%, 9%, 7%, and 5%, respectively.
During 2021, the Group generated non-recurring gains of ₱527 mn primarily due to the revaluation of dollar-denominated assets, compared to ₱477 mn non-recurring losses recorded in 2020. Without these one-off losses, the Group’s core net income for 2021 was ₱26.8 bn, 68% higher YoY. AEV recorded a 16% increase in consolidated EBITDA for 2021 compared to 2020, from ₱57.7 bn to ₱67.2 bn.

The following discussion describes material changes in the line items of the Company’s statement of income and of comprehensive income for 2021 compared to 2020.

The Group’s revenue from the Power Group’s sale of power increased by 22% or ₱24.2 bn, from ₱109.9 bn in 2020 to ₱134.0 bn in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) higher availability of TLI, TSI, and TVI facilities during 2021, and (ii) higher WESM dispatch in compliance with the must- offer rule. The Group’s sale of power comprised 59% and 60% as a percentage of total revenues in 2020 and in 2021, respectively.

The Group’s revenue from sale of goods increased by 17% or ₱12.2 bn, from ₱71.3 bn in 2020 to ₱83.1 bn in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher feeds selling prices. The Group’s sale of goods comprised 38% and 37% as a percentage of total revenues in 2020 and in 2021, respectively.

The Group’s revenue from real estate increased by 48% or ₱1.7 bn, from ₱3.5 bn in 2020 to ₱5.2 bn in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to AboitizLand’s higher revenue recognition following increased construction activity for its residential business, as well as increased sales with higher spot down payments. As a percentage of total revenues, the Group’s revenue from real estate comprised 2% in both 2020 and in 2021.

The Group’s combined revenue from the fair value of swine, service fees, and other sources decreased by 22% or ₱0.4 bn, from ₱2.0 bn in 2020 to ₱1.6 bn in 2021. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in live hogs sold. As a percentage of total revenues, the Group’s other revenues comprised 1% in both 2020 and in 2021.

The Group’s cost of generated and purchased power increased by 37% or ₱20.1 bn, from ₱54.9 bn in 2020 to ₱75.0 bn in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher purchased power rates driven by higher WESM prices, and higher fuel cost. As a percentage of total costs and expenses, the Group’s cost of generated and purchased power comprised 35% and 39% in 2020 and in 2021, respectively.

The Group’s cost of goods sold increased by 20% or ₱12.1 bn, from ₱61.5 bn in 2020 to ₱73.6 bn in 2021. The increase was mainly attributable to higher raw materials cost of the Food Group. As a percentage of total costs and expenses, the Group’s cost of goods sold comprised 40% and 39% in 2020 and in 2021, respectively.

The Group’s operating expenses increased by 7% or ₱2.8 bn, from ₱37.1 bn in 2020 to ₱39.9 bn in 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher expenses for insurance and repairs and maintenance of the Group’s power plants. As a percentage of total costs and expenses, the Group’s operating expenses comprised 24% and 21% in 2020 and in 2021, respectively.

For 2021, the Group’s cost of real estate sales increased by 34% or ₱0.6 bn, from ₱1.7 bn in 2020 to ₱2.3 bn in 2021. The increase was mainly driven by higher real estate sales. As a percentage of total costs and expenses, the Group’s cost of real estate sales comprised 1% in both 2020 and in 2021.

As a result of the foregoing, the Group’s operating profit increased by 5% or ₱1.6 bn, from ₱31.5 bn in 2020 to ₱33.1 bn in 2021.

The Group’s income before income tax increased by 30% or ₱8.6 bn, from ₱28.4 bn in 2020 to ₱37.0 bn in 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher operating profit and equity earnings.

As a result of the foregoing, coupled with the application of the provisions of the CREATE Act, the Group’s Net Income to Equity Holders of the Parent increased by 77% or ₱11.9 bn, from ₱15.4 bn in 2020 to ₱27.3 bn in 2021.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests for 2021 increased to ₱6.9 bn from ₱5.4 bn in 2020. This was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income of AboitizPower in 2021.

The following discussion describes the performance of the Group’s SBUs for 2021 compared to 2020.
For 2021, the Power Group’s contribution to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV, before elimination of transactions within the Group, was ₱16.0 bn, a 66% increase from ₱9.7 bn in 2020.
Before elimination of transactions within the Group, the combined contribution of AboitizPower’s Power Generation and Retail Electricity Supply businesses to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV increased by 84%, from ₱9.2 bn in 2020 to ₱16.9 bn in 2021. The variance was primarily due to (i) commissioning revenue from GNPD Unit 1, (ii) higher water inflows for the Power Group’s hydro plants, higher availability of TLI, TSI, and TVI facilities, (iii) higher WESM dispatch, and (iv) other income from liquidated damages for the delay in the construction of GNPD Units 1 and 2 and business interruption claims resulting from GMEC and APRI outages in previous years. These gains were partially offset by lower margins resulting from the GMEC outage during 2021.
Capacity sold increased from 3,417 MW for 2020 to 3,753 MW for 2021. Energy sold in 2021 increased by 14% to 26,031 GWh from 22,754 GWh in 2020.
Before elimination of transactions within the Group, the contribution to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV of AboitizPower’s Power Distribution Group increased by 13% from ₱2.7 bn in 2020 to ₱3.1 bn in 2021. This increase was mainly driven by higher energy consumption resulting from recoveries in demand. Energy sales increased by 4% to 5,584 GWh during 2021 from 5,368 GWh in 2020.

UnionBank’s contribution to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV increased by 9% YoY, from ₱5.9 bn in 2020 to ₱6.4 bn in 2021. The increase was due to higher net interest income, which grew to ₱29.8 bn, 4% higher YoY due to the sustained increase in net interest margins. Non-interest income in 2021 was ₱15.3 bn, up 14% YoY, due to higher fees, service charges, foreign exchange income and trading gains.

Before elimination of transactions within the Group, the contribution to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV from the Food Group decreased by 10% to ₱2.0 bn in 2021, compared to ₱2.2 bn in 2020.
The Food Group’s Agribusiness segment, which consists of the regional animal nutrition businesses (feed, petfood, and specialty nutrition), reported net income of ₱1.3 bn in 2021, 44% lower than the ₱2.3 bn in 2020. This is due to a decline in margins resulting from the sharp increase in raw material costs.
The Food Group’s Food and Nutrition segment, which consists of the flour, farms, meats, and trading divisions, recorded net income of ₱934 mn in 2021, 365% higher YoY. This was primarily due to increased income from the Farm business as pork prices increased due to lack of supply in the market during 2021, supported by incremental income coming from commodity trading. These offset the decline in income from the Flour business stemming from the increase in raw material costs, in addition to decreased by- product margins.

The contribution of AboitizLand to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV in 2021, before elimination of transactions within the Group, amounted to ₱2.6 bn, a 658% increase from ₱338 mn in 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher revenue recognition from increased construction and site development activities for AboitizLand's residential business, and an increase in sales performance with higher spot down payments, coupled with asset monetization and fair valuation gains on investment properties.

Before elimination of transactions within the Group, the contribution to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV from the Infrastructure Group increased by 203% to ₱1.4 bn in 2021, compared to ₱457 mn in 2020. The increase was mainly due to the higher contribution of the RCBM Group which increased by 164% from ₱590 mn in 2020 to ₱1.6 bn in 2021. The increase was mainly due to stronger market demand from the residential and infrastructure segments during 2021, as well as increased overall efficiency resulting from capital investments. RCBM also benefited in 2021 from a one-time gain brought about by the CREATE bill which reduced its deferred tax liabilities.

Consolidated assets (as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020) increased by 20% to ₱733.6 bn, due to the following:
Cash & Cash Equivalents increased by 124% (₱147.5 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱66.0 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due to proceeds from the sale non-controlling interest in December 2021 arising from the sale by AEV of a 25.01% ownership interest in AboitizPower to JERA Asia.
Trade and other receivables (current and noncurrent) increased by 23% (₱48.4 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱39.4 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due to increased receivables of the Power and Real Estate Groups as a result of higher revenues.
Inventories increased by 34% (₱29.1 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱21.6 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due to higher spare parts, supplies and fuel inventory of the Power Group, and higher raw materials inventory of the Food Group.
Investment Property increased by 12% (₱12.2 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱10.9 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due to the fair valuation gain on revaluation of real estate properties during 2021.
Investments in and Advances to Associates and Joint Ventures increased by ₱9.4 bn (₱154.8 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱145.4 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due to ₱994 mn infusion into Unity Digital Infrastructure, Inc., AboitizPower’s ₱952 mn additional infusion into GNPD, ₱310 mn other comprehensive income, and the recording of ₱17.2 bn share in net earnings of Associates and Joint Ventures. This increase was partially reduced by the ₱10.2 bn dividends from Associates and Joint Ventures.
Other Current Assets (OCA) increased by 36% (₱25.4 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱18.7 bn as of December 31, 2020) primarily due to the increase in short-term cash deposits and prepaid expenses.
Net Derivative Assets and Liabilities (current and noncurrent) changed from ₱2.0 bn net derivative liability as of December 31, 2020 to ₱105 mn net derivative asset as of December 31, 2021 mainly due to the Power Group’s hedging gains.
Intangible Assets increased by 10% (₱74.3 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱67.8 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due to the forex revaluation of goodwill and additions to service concession rights relating to Apo Agua Bulk Water project.
The above increases were offset by the 5% decrease in land and improvements (₱2.9 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱3.0 bn as of December 31, 2020) caused by the reclassification of newly launched project by the Real Estate Group to inventory.

Total Liabilities (as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020) increased by 5% to ₱405.8 bn due to the following:
Bank loans increased by 21% (₱35.4 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱29.3 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due to new loan availments during 2021 by the Power and Food Groups.
Long-term debt, which includes both current and noncurrent portions, increased by 4% (₱271.7 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱261.0 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due to the following: (i) issuance of retail bonds by AboitizPower amounting to ₱26.0 bn, (ii) issuance of retail bonds by AEV amounting to ₱10.0 bn, and (iii) ₱11.8 bn of new loan availments by subsidiaries. This was partly offset by the prepayment of AEV's seven-year 2015 Series B and ten-year 2013 Series B retail bonds and AboitizPower's partial prepayment of the US$ 300 mn syndicated bridge loan facility availed in 2019 to finance the AA Thermal, Inc. acquisition, and principal payments made on existing loans during 2021.
Long-term obligation on Power Distribution System, which includes current and noncurrent portions, decreased by 10% (₱166 mn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱183 mn as of December 31, 2020) as regular annual payments were made.
Lease liabilities, which includes current and noncurrent portions, decreased by 14% (₱34.3 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱39.8 bn as of December 31, 2020) due to TLI’s payment on its obligation to PSALM during 2021.
Trade and other payables, inclusive of noncurrent portion, increased by 25% (₱46.8 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱37.3 bn as of December 31, 2020) mainly due the increase of trade and fuel purchases in the Power Group, and raw materials purchases of the Food Group.
Income tax payable decreased by 62%, from ₱1.0 bn as of December 31, 2020 to ₱0.4 bn as of December 31, 2021 mainly due to the reduction in income tax rates from 30% in 2020 to 25% in 2021.
Customers' deposits increased by 6%, from ₱7.0 bn as of December 31, 2020 to ₱7.4 bn as of December 31, 2021, mainly due to the receipt of bill deposits from new customers.
Decommissioning liability increased by 14%, from ₱5.0 bn as of December 31, 2020 to ₱5.7 bn as of December 31, 2021, mainly due to the recognition of additional decommissioning provisions on power plant assets.
Deferred Income Tax Liabilities decreased by 5% (₱2.3 bn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱2.4 bn as of December 31, 2020) due to the reduction in income tax rates.
Pension Liabilities (net of Pension assets) decreased to ₱200 mn as of December 31, 2021 compared to ₱459 mn as of December 31, 2020 mainly due to actuarial gains.

Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent (as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020) increased by ₱61.6 bn from ₱183.1 bn to ₱244.7 bn, due to the following:
₱27.3 bn net income recorded during the year;
₱35.0 bn additional equity reserve from the sale of non-controlling interest; and,
₱4.4 bn in other comprehensive income
These are partly offset by the ₱5.1 bn cash dividends paid during 2021.
Non-controlling interests increased 105%, from ₱40.5 bn as of December 31, 2020 to ₱83.1 bn as of December 31, 2021 mainly due to the sale of shares of AboitizPower.


For 2021, the Group continued to support its liquidity mainly from cash generated from operations, additional loans availed, dividends received from Associates and Joint Ventures, and sale of non- controlling interest.
Compared to the cash inflow during 2020, consolidated cash generated from operating activities for 2021 increased by ₱98 mn to ₱36.3 bn. The increase was mainly due to higher earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, and lower taxes paid, partly offset by higher working capital requirements.
As of December 31, 2021, ₱10.1 bn net cash was used in investing activities compared to ₱11.5 bn during 2020. This was mainly due to higher cash dividends received from associates and joint ventures compared to 2020. Out of the cash usage for the current period, ₱6.0 bn was invested in short-term cash deposits to maximize interest income.
Net cash from financing activities was ₱53.0 bn for 2021 compared to ₱4.3 bn used in 2020. This was largely attributed to the proceeds from the sale of non-controlling interest and new debt availments.
For 2021, net cash inflows surpassed cash outflows, resulting in a 124% increase in cash and cash equivalents from ₱66.0 bn as of year-end 2020 to ₱147.5 bn as of December 31, 2021.

AEV’s Current Ratio as of December 31, 2021 increased to 2.3x compared to end-2020's 1.6x mainly due to higher cash balances. Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased to 1.2:1 as of December 31, 2021 from year- end 2020’s 1.7:1, as the increase in equity outpaced the increase in total liabilities.

Based on information provided by UnionBank Economic Research Unit, the Company expects the Philippines’ GDP to grow by 6.1% in 2022 and 6.3% in 2023. Internal research indicates that a more robust economic recovery took place in the fourth quarter of 2021 with declining Covid-19 cases and rising levels of fully vaccinated people.
On September 27, 2021, AEV disclosed that it had executed an agreement to sell 1,840,334,941 common shares in AboitizPower, representing approximately twenty-five point zero one percent (25.01%) of the total outstanding common shares of stock of AboitizPower, to JERA Asia Private Limited (“JERA Asia”) for approximately US$ 1.46 bn. This transaction was completed on December 10, 2021 with the ratification by AEV’s shareholders in a special stockholders meeting. AEV, which still owns a controlling stake of approximately 52% in AboitizPower, will use the cash proceeds from the sale to fund the long-term growth strategy, including expanding the non-power share in its business portfolio, increasing its overseas activities, and refinancing higher cost debt.

AboitizPower remains focused on addressing the needs of its markets, namely: (1) providing reliable supply, at a (2) reasonable cost, and with (3) minimal impact on the environment and communities. AboitizPower believes that there is no single technology that completely addresses the country’s energy requirements and that to address the deficiency, a mix of power generation technologies is necessary. Thus, AboitizPower continues to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies where and when it makes sense.
Despite increased competition in the power generation market, AboitizPower believes that it has built the foundation to sustain its long-term growth, as seen in its pipeline of new power generation projects.
AboitizPower has over 1,000 MW of projects under construction which are expected to commercially operate in 2022: the GNPower Dinginin Project (the “Dinginin Project”); the PV Sinag Power Cayanga Project (the “Cayanga Solar Project”); the TMI Maco Hybrid Battery Energy Storage System Project (the “Maco BESS Project”).
GNPD Unit 1 officially went on COD last January 26, 2022. Unit 2 has started commissioning. The target for Unit 2’s initial synchronization remains to be the second quarter of 2022, from which GNPD Unit 2 may start earning revenues.
The PV Sinag Power Cayanga Project is for the construction of a 94 MWp solar power plant located in barangay Cayanga, municipality of Bugallon, Pangasinan. The EPC contract was awarded to JGC Philippines last December 2021. Its groundbreaking ceremony was held last February 2022. The project is expected to commercially operate by the fourth quarter of 2022.
The Maco BESS Project is located in Maco, Compostela Valley. It has a storage capacity of 49 MW and is intended to be used for ancillary services. Development activities are ongoing to integrate the battery energy storage system with TMI’s Maco oil barge. The project nears completion at around 90% with the BESS barge moored in the TMI facility right next to the power barge. The mobilized technical team continues to work on the testing and commissioning activities to get the plant running in May 2022. It will serve as a model for future battery investments as well as hybrid renewable energy projects.
On top of the projects under construction, AboitizPower has a 160 MWp of renewable energy (RE) project expected to be issued a notice to proceed in 2022: the PV Sinag Power Laoag project (“Laoag Solar Project”). The Laoag Solar Project is expected to commercially operate by the third quarter of 2023.
AboitizPower also has an additional capacity of 721 MW of RE projects under priority development which are expected to commercially operate by 2024 to 2025: (i) the 10 MW SN AboitizPower Magat BESS Project; (ii) the 84 MWp PV Sinag Power San Manuel Solar Project; (iii) the 44 MWp AP Renewable Energy Corporation Tarlac Solar Project; (iv) the 40 MW Hedcor Bukidnon Kibungan Hydro Project; (v) the 212 MWp PV Sinag Power Olongapo Solar Project; (vi) the 56 MWp PV Sinag Power Ramon Solar Project; (vii) the 50 MWp PV Sinag Power Gamu Solar Project; (viii) the 75 MWp SN AboitizPower-Magat Floating Solar Project; (ix) and the 150 MWp Aboitiz Solar Power Inc Calatrava Solar Project.
In relation to AboitizPower’s existing capacity, the steam field operator for APRI has commenced the drilling of 12 new wells, which are expected to result in a minimum 50 MW of aggregated individual well capacity by 2023. As of 2021, four wells were completed. Four more will be added by 2022, and another four by 2023. In Tiwi, the initiative to convert waste heat from the geothermal brine to power a 15 MW Binary power plant is reaching the final stages of tender. The project is expected to commercially operate by the third quarter of 2023.
AboitizPower targets to double its capacity to 9,200 MW by 2030. It intends to achieve a 50:50 balance between its renewable (“Cleanergy”) and thermal capacities, without new coal builds. This is expected to come from a portfolio of renewables and selective baseload builds.
AboitizPower aims to maximize opportunities from the implementation of the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) by the DOE. In line with DOE’s aspirational goal of a 35% share in renewable energy utilization by 2030, RPS is a market-based policy that mandates power distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and retail electricity suppliers to source an agreed portion of their energy supplies from renewable energy facilities. AboitizPower will continue to pursue international opportunities, with a continued focus on renewable energy projects in wind, hydro, and solar in high growth geographic markets with acceptable regulatory environments.
AboitizPower targets to significantly grow Cleanergy by 3,700 MW, both domestically and internationally, and bring its renewable portfolio to 4,600 MW by 2030.
AboitizPower is optimizing its existing baseload facilities to meet critical market needs. Baseload demand will continue to increase. There is a need to address this in the absence of new coal plants. AboitizPower is currently conducting studies for viable alternatives to coal. In the event of a critical shortage, AboitizPower’s third unit options located in existing baseload facilities may respond if called upon. AboitizPower is also shifting its focus to gas for baseload growth. It has early feasibility studies, and within the next ten years, expects to construct one gas plant with a capacity of 1,000 MW, unless a cleaner technology proves to be the more economical option.
AboitizPower fully supports the DOE’s coal moratorium efforts to make the Philippine energy system more flexible, resilient, and sustainable. AboitizPower is also closely and proactively monitoring the risks associated with climate-related regulations and initiatives, including recent discussions on the early retirement of coal assets in the Philippines and Indonesia. AboitizPower, through its parent company, AEV, is the first Philippine company to sign up and commit to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure framework. AboitizPower has taken steps to proactively quantify the potential impacts of various climate regulations on its assets. AboitizPower is monitoring this risk as part of its risk management framework and is developing strategies to manage risks that are above certain risk thresholds.
Given the current state of power needs in the Philippines and the expected build progression of new plants over the next ten years, AboitizPower believes its existing coal assets will need to continue to play a significant role for at least another 15 to 20 years. AboitizPower is always looking at improvements to make sure it continues to operate its assets responsibly and in compliance with all regulations.
AboitizPower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. It expects its financial condition to give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.
AboitizPower, together with its partners, has allotted ₱28 bn for capital expenditures in 2022, for the development and construction of various solar power, hydro power, and battery energy-storage system, and the continuous improvement of reliability of baseload plants.
Last December 2021, JERA completed the acquisition of a 27% ownership stake in AboitizPower. This partnership is expected to enhance and enable AboitizPower’s planned ten-year energy expansion journey.
AboitizPower and JERA have agreed to explore immediate collaboration in the following areas: (i) development of power projects, including (Liquified Natural Gas) LNG-to-Power projects; (ii) management and sourcing of LNG fuel supply; and (iii) potential participation in aspects of plant operation and maintenance.
Other known trends, events, uncertainties which may have a material impact on AboitizPower have been discussed extensively in the AboitizPower’s portion of this Annual Report (e.g. for an extensive discussion on regulatory issues, see AboitizPower’s Effects of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on the Business on page 59 of this Annual Report).

UnionBank continues to pursue its business transformation roadmap towards becoming one of the top three universal banks in the Philippines in terms of return on equity, return on assets, and cost- efficiency. Rather than using traditional metrics such as asset size or branch network, this transformation roadmap shifts the Bank’s focus to providing financial value to stakeholders, operational excellence, customer franchise or share of wallet, unique customer experience, and superior and innovative products and services.
To fulfill its vision, the Bank’s primary goal is to become one of the country’s great retail banks by increasing its core earning asset base, attaining balanced sources of revenues, and shifting towards a recurring income business model as it fortifies its balance sheet.
The Bank has made progress in achieving its primary goal. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of the Bank’s revenues were recurring in nature as its loan portfolio grew above the industry average over the past five (5) years (the Bank’s 5yr average was at 15% compared to the industry’s average of 9%). In addition, the Bank’s retail segment already accounts for a significant portion of the Bank’s revenues.
UnionBank continues to leverage on its core strengths: (i) Capital, (ii) Branch Transformation, (iii) Corporate Relationships, (iv) Processes, (v) Partners, and (vi) its unique UnionBank DNA. It leverages on Capital by prompting a shift from trading to building recurring income to generate stable returns and predictability in the growth of shareholder value. It leverages on Branch Transformation by establishing the competence of the Bank’s sales force, rather than expanding the brick-and-mortar network, to cater to changing customer expectations. It leverages on Corporate Relationships, by providing superior cash management solutions to anchor clients and in the process, penetrate their entire ecosystem. It leverages on Processes by building the foundation of the Bank’s automation and digital transformation initiatives. It leverages on Partners by building synergies for the expansion of products and services, as well as customer reach. It leverages on having a unique UnionBank DNA by building the right culture and organizational capabilities. The Bank also leverages its subsidiaries to serve the unbanked or underbanked segment for inclusive prosperity.
In 2015, the Bank embarked on a Digital Transformation Strategy to gain a competitive advantage and capitalize on the eventual shift of the Philippine banking industry towards digitalization. The Banks’ Digital Transformation Strategy consisted of two objectives:
1) To strengthen its business model by repositioning itself into an agile and digitally-transformed universal bank. The Bank’s strategy was (i) to apply higher technologies into its core banking systems and processes to deliver superior customer experiences; and (ii) to employ its digitized processes to transform CitySavings and its subsidiaries into digital mass market focused-banks. The goal was to reach the underbanked and unbanked segments and employ the Bank’s digitized processes to improve operational efficiencies in order to ramp up scale and accelerate achieving inclusive prosperity.
2) To search for new business models where banking may become embedded or disintermediated in people’s day-to-day lives. The objective was to immerse the Bank in emerging technologies and new business models which may disrupt the business of banking. The Bank sought to develop, enable, and invest in financial technology (“fintech”) companies, as their business models may evolve into the future of the financial landscape. Moreover, the Bank planned to make technology its core and to deliver digital platforms and solutions to meet its clients’ banking needs. All these served to integrate the Bank in any supply and demand chain, making the Bank indispensable in a future where banking will no longer be a transaction choice but part of an integrated experience. These have, since 2019, been led by UBX PH, the Bank’s technology and innovation Subsidiary.
Having completed Phase 1 (i.e., building the foundational infrastructure to be “Digital to the Core” and transforming people and culture to be an “Agile Organization”) and Phase 2 (i.e. launch of critical customer channels), UnionBank is already in Phase 3 of its Digital Transformation – the monetization and commercialization of the Bank’s digital transformation. With the key channels and platforms now in place, the Bank is focused on accelerating its customer acquisition and deepening engagement across all digital channels to achieve sustained growth of its lending and deposit businesses and, at the same time, reap operational efficiencies from its digital investments.
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift in consumer behavior towards digital banking. The banking industry in general, and UnionBank in particular, experienced immense growth in electronic transactions (e.g. fund transfers, in-app bills payment, etc.), as well as increased users of digital channels and applications since 2020. The Bank expects the digital trend to continue, especially as more Filipinos discover and experience the advantages of digital payments and digital banking.
UBX PH also ramped up in the operations with its flagship platforms, namely: (i) i2i (a financial platform for financial institutions); (ii) BUX (a payment gateway and logistics fulfillment platform for online merchants); (iii) Sentro (a free online shop builder embedded with a payment gateway); and (iv) SeekCap (a lending marketplace for MSMEs offering various financing options and faster approvals). With the growth of E-Commerce during the pandemic, UBX PH sign-ups and transactions grew exponentially, which translated to increased recurring revenues.
In July 2021, the Bank obtained a digital bank license for its fully-digital bank, UnionDigital. Set to be launched in 2022, UnionDigital is envisioned to capture the underbanked segments of the population by offering superior customer experience with a cost-efficient infrastructure and organization.
Moreover, in December 2021, the Bank also announced its acquisition of Citigroup’s consumer banking business in the Philippines. The transaction includes Citi’s credit card, personal loans, wealth management, and retail deposit businesses. The acquisition also includes Citi’s real estate interests in relation to Citibank Square in Eastwood, 3 full-service bank branches, and 5 wealth centers. The acquisition will accelerate the Bank’s objective of becoming a ‘Great Retail Bank’ given Citi’s market leadership in the credit cards, personal loans, and wealth management business. Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022.
With the Bank’s digital thrust, the Bank believes that it is well-positioned to leverage on the digital trends as it carries on with the commercialization program of its transformation. For 2022, the Bank’s key focus areas include: (i) improving the Bank’s operations and delivery of products and services via Cloud Migration, DevSecOps, and continuous enhancement of our digital channels as we further scale up in terms of customers and transactions; (ii) continuing growth and maximize profitability in the mass market segments we are in; (iii) further ramping up the growth of UBX PH’s platforms to sustain growth in recurring revenues; (iv) successfully launching UnionDigital; and (v) most importantly, ensuring the smooth transition of Citi’s employees and customers to the Bank. UnionBank also intends to ride on the wave of the economy’s recovery and improving consumer demand to push for further growth of its core lending business. To support these initiatives, the Bank has allotted almost ₱4 bn for capital expenditures in 2022.
The Bank’s strong capitalization and above-industry profitability and efficiency ratios will continue to provide cushion against potential economic headwinds.

The Food Group, composed of AEV’s non-listed multinational food Subsidiaries, is an integrated regional agribusiness and food company based in the Philippines and Singapore. Its businesses in the Philippines include flour milling, feed milling, livestock farming, and commodity trading. It remains one of the Philippines’ top flour, feeds, and farm market players and has a nationwide presence. The Food Group also operates in the ASEAN and across the Asia-Pacific regions through Pilmico International Pte. Ltd. And its subsidiaries – which includes Gold Coin Management Holdings Limited (Gold Coin) and is well- positioned in Asia Pacific as a manufacturer and producer of animal and aqua feeds.
In January 2022, the Food Group internally reorganized its businesses into two key business segments, namely; (i) Agribusiness and (ii) Food and Nutrition business. Agribusiness segment consists of its regional (i.e. local and international) animal nutrition businesses (feed, petfood, and specialty nutrition divisions). Meanwhile, the Food and Nutrition business segment consists of businesses that cater to the consumer segment of the value chain (flour, farms, meats, and trading divisions) in the Philippines. It also includes retail and other business-to-customer (B2C)-oriented businesses. This reorganization will allow the Food Group to better deliver its identified strategic pillars (i.e. balance, optimize and develop) through improvement in internal collaboration, increasing the speed and efficiency in execution, and capitalizing on the synergize that exists in the business as they present themselves.
In order to achieve the Food Group’s Vision “to become an integrated regional business and food company”, the Food Group will (i) maintain a balanced portfolio by diversifying revenues and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) across geographies, businesses, and products to increase its resilience, (ii) focus on operational excellence, cost control, and leverage on technology, and Furthermore, it (iii) pursue building new growth platforms by investing in fast-growing and higher-margin segments of the industry. Overall, this approach will serve as the compass in steering the Food Group to achieve its growth targets in the coming years.
The acquisition of the Gold Coin and its Subsidiaries (the “Gold Coin Group”) has allowed the Food Group to expand its customer base and geographic reach. Following the acquisition, the Company believes the Food Group to be the fourth largest animal feed producer in Southeast Asia based on internal market dataofthecapacitiesofmajorplayerswithinthemarket. TheFoodGrouphasandcontinuestoharness synergies in distribution, localized operations, cross-selling, research and development, raw materials, and logistics costs.
The flour division will continue employing the improved two-pronged market strategy of: (i) maximizing growth potential in the Visayas region and Mindanao island, while (ii) building and developing new channels in Luzon for future exploration of new geographical territory. The flour business likewise intends to move forward in the value chain as it continues selling value-added flour products, protecting its market share, and potentially expanding into a more diversified product portfolio.
Meanwhile, the farms division started the construction of its third Breeder Farm in 2021 and it is expected to be completed in July 2022. This will yield an additional capacity of 2,500 sow level and will help in the recovery of the supply of pork in the Philippine Market. The expansion is anchored on the confidence brought about by the improved biosecurity protocols and methodology that will thrive despite the presence of African Swine Fever (ASF) in the country. With the planned expansion, Farms’ sow level capacity is expected to reach 60,000 heads by 2026. The increase in volume comes with opportunities to unlock more distribution channels and to push forward integration in the value chain.
In August 2020, the Food Group operationalized its meat fabrication and processing plant in Tarlac, which is expected to provide more stable profitability through selling high-margin pork meats compared to live hog selling. With ASF hitting the swine farming industry in 2019, the latter (i.e live hog selling) has not fully recovered yet the lost capacity and unserved demand for pork meat is eased up through meat importation. This presents an opportunity for the Food Group to further augment the volume of its Meats business through external sources and improve on its meat processing facility utilization.
The pork meat products of the Food Group are now made available in the Philippines through different digital platforms such as Lazada and the Food Group’s online meat store branded as “The Good Meat”.
On top of one existing store, 11 new physical stores are planned to be fully operational by the end of 2022, with an expected capacity of 2 MT per day per store. Furthermore, a total of 80 retail concessionaires stores are expected to sell the Good Meat products by the end of 2022. This initiative will do two things for the Food Group – (i) further develop its B2C channels and (ii) provide an expansion to the supply chain which will ensure better distribution to all customers in the relevant areas.
The targeted increase in layers capacity still remains, which is expected to result in a monthly production of 22 mn eggs by 2025.
The Agribusiness segment in the Philippines seeks to solidify its market position through expanding production in strategic locations in the Visayas and Mindanao regions in the next five years. To support the wider market, the Food Group will employ platform improvements in logistics to enhance operational agility and improve customer experience. The Food Group believes that continuous product developments through precise nutrition and feeding management, the introduction of pet food, and the building-up of specialty nutrition are key to a strengthened and diversified Agribusiness portfolio.
The Gold Coin Group (under the Agribusiness segment) will pursue (i) fast-growing segments like aquafeeds and (ii) attractive geographies where it has a captive market and the ability to compete. In 2021, several plant expansions took place within the region. An additional fish feed line located in Malaysia (West Port, Malaysia) with a capacity of 5 tons per hour (“TPH”) commenced operations in April 2021. China also expanded to Guangxi via capital-light options (leasing) to serve the customers from Guizhou province (currently being supplied by Yunnan) and save on freight at the same time. Meanwhile, in Indonesia a raw material warehouse expansion was completed. The facility can store up to 3,000 MT and is intended to improve efficiency, stability of production, and reduce external warehouse dependencies. China and Vietnam will continue to expand their livestock feedmill facility with an additional capacity of 30 TPH each mill. Construction will be completed in June 2023 and December 2023, respectively.
These carefully selected and calibrated investments are expected to capture greater returns while steadily building a strong and diversified regional food business integrated across the business system.
Food Group has allotted ₱6 bn for capital expenditures in 2022.

Aboitiz InfraCapital remains committed to participating in the Philippine infrastructure space and contributing to its economic recovery amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
2022 is expected to be a growth year – Apo Agua is expected to begin operations, Unity is planning to accelerate its tower rollout, while the Economic Estates are continuing their expansion.

In 2021, LIMA Estate introduced a new commercial lot product, which was met with overwhelming market response. The commercial lots presented a new opportunity for investors who seek to be part of the growing 30-hectare central business district within LIMA Estate – the first to rise in Batangas. LIMA Estate has emerged as more than just a leading industrial estate, but also the center for commerce in the Batangas province. It currently houses various commercial components such as The Outlets at Lipa, LIMA Exchange, LIMA Park Hotel, and LIMA Transport Hub.
LIMA Estate also recently broke ground on LIMA Tower One, a PEZA-certified building which boasts 34,000 square meters of gross floor area. It is the first of its planned seven-tower office park at the heart of LIMA’s central business district, which aims to capitalize on the anticipated boom of business process outsourcing companies outside the National Capital region.
Additional expansion plans for the Economic Estates continue. Construction of LIMA’s 47-hectare industrial expansion finished in 2021 at 80% completion. In addition, another 57-hectare industrial expansion recently started construction and will be followed by a 96-hectare expansion in 2023. Once completed, these new developments are expected to generate approximately 75,000 jobs and will increase LIMA Estate’s working population to 137,000.
West Cebu Estate in Balamban, Cebu is also embarking on new developments. In February 2022, it broke ground on 39 hectares of its 540-hectare property. This will allow for more industrial spaces, commercial centers and dormitory developments. New locators and businesses that will be brought in are expected to yield up to 14,000 new jobs for the community.
Looking ahead, Economic Estates will continue to expand its footprint in the country and introduce new products and services to stakeholders within its developments. The estates will undergo continuous transformation through the introduction of sustainable and smart city features. Additionally, to increase the adaptation of sustainability into its developments, Aboitiz InfraCapital has partnered with Philippine Green Building Council in acquiring BERDE (Building for Ecologically Responsive Design Excellence) certifications for LIMA Estate, LIMA Tower One, and The Outlets at Lipa.

Lima Water is the exclusive water and wastewater services provider of LIMA Technology Center (“LTC”), one of the Philippines’ largest industrial parks. Lima Water is currently building its capability to fully support the expansion plans of LTC and other affiliated economic estates, which are expected to experience healthy growth in the coming years.
Lima Water remains optimistic that earnings and water consumption will continue to improve with new production lines from existing and new locators in LIMA Estate, as well as potential new coverage areas at affiliated economic estates, and expanded ancillary services. Lima Water remains committed to supporting its customers and ensuring uninterrupted service through its robust business continuity plans and smart water network system.

Apo Agua is the project company owned by Aboitiz InfraCapital and JVACC, organized to design, construct and operate a hydroelectric powered-bulk water treatment facility and a conveyance system which will deliver at least 300 mn liters per day of treated water to the Davao City Water District (DCWD) over 30 years.
As of end 2021, an estimated total of 65 kilometers of pipes of varying sizes are being laid, leading to eight off-take points of the DCWD spread across Davao City. Although construction was suspended during the second quarter of 2020 when the City was placed under enhanced community quarantine, construction has since resumed with strict social distancing protocols in place.
To mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the project, Apo Agua and its contractor, JVACC, increased its human resource count to over 5,000 workers to support the aggressive recovery plan in line with the target of beginning operations in 2022.
Aboitiz InfraCapital intends to use its current water portfolio, including a 16% stake in Balibago WaterworksSystem,Inc.,asastrategicplatformtobuilditswaterbusiness. Itwilllookintounderserved highly-urbanized cities for opportunities to expand its footprint in the water space across the country.


In line with the Department of Information and Communication Technology’s Department Circular No. 8, Aboitiz InfraCapital received the Independent Tower Company (ITC) Certificate of Registration for its towers subsidiary on February 24, 2021. The ITC Certificate of Registration recognizes Aboitiz InfraCapital’s tower subsidiary as a common tower provider with the necessary financial and operational capability to build, operate, and maintain common passive telecom infrastructure and efficiently power its cell sites and allow the company to secure contracts with mobile network operators.
In April 2021, Aboitiz InfraCapital announced the launch of Unity Digital Infrastructure, Inc., a joint venture telecommunications infrastructure platform with Partners Group. Unity is focused on delivering its growing pipeline of sites, currently with 85 signed ground leases and 40 sites under construction.
Aboitiz InfraCapital has also entered into partnership agreements with Globe Telecom and Dito Telecommunity to deploy small cell sites in key cities nationwide. The sites are readily available in high- density urbanized areas like Cebu, Davao, and Subic, where improving network quality and services is difficult due to congestion and the availability of sites. The sites will serve as complementary offerings to the macro tower sites and the deployments are ongoing to meet the accelerated demand for improved telecommunication services. More than 350 small cell sites in Cebu, Davao, and Subic were deployed as of 2021 year-end.
Unity is in active business with all three mobile network operators, with a target of over 1,000 operating macro towers and small cell sites to be completed in 2022.

The DOTr granted Aboitiz InfraCapital the Original Proponent Status for its unsolicited proposals (i) to operate, maintain, and expand the new Bohol-Panglao International Airport on September 3, 2018 and (ii) to operate and maintain the Bicol International Airport on September 7, 2021. The same status was received from CAAP for Laguindingan Airport on February 26, 2019. On November 29, 2019, Aboitiz InfraCapital obtained the approval of the National Economic Development Authority Board for the Bohol unsolicited proposal, while the Investment Coordination Committee-Cabinet Committee (ICC- CabCom) approved the proposal for Laguindingan Airport on December 20, 2019.
In the face of the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on the air travel and airport business, Aboitiz InfraCapital remains keen on pursuing its unsolicited proposals for the Bohol Panglao and Bicol International Airports, and Laguindingan Airport. Aboitiz InfraCapital believes that these projects are vital to reviving the economy and are aligned with its objective to support regional growth centers outside of the National Capital Region. Aboitiz InfraCapital continues to discuss the best and most prudent way to move forward with the projects with the government.

Cement demand outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. The government has allotted a significant proportion of the 2022 national budget on infrastructure. However, election-related bans and change in administration may impact the infrastructure demand. In addition, the pandemic continues to present a risk on economic recovery which in turn might also impact demand in residential and non- residential segments.
RCBM remains committed to serving its key markets throughout the country with high-quality products, while improving efficiencies and reducing costs. Two newly-commissioned mills provide RCBM with additional 2.3 million tonnes per annum (“MTPA”) capacity to serve the market needs.
RCBM is currently experiencing inflationary pressures in certain global commodities, particularly coal, which impacts its production costs. In an effort to mitigate the impact of its external headwinds, RCBM continues to focus on operational excellence initiatives and cost control measures.
RCBM will also continue to staunchly support the Philippine government’s Go Lokal and Buy Lokal programs, as an industry leader and proud manufacturer of the country’s best quality cement used in building a safer, greener, and stronger republic.
The infrastructure group has allotted ₱29 bn for capital expenditures in 2022 across all its businesses.

AboitizLand is committed to innovating ways to lead more families home in 2022 and the years to come. It will continue to be focused on further improving all aspects of operations. As it continues to become better and more efficient in all areas of operations, AboitizLand is now also able to put more focus on the customer: understanding its needs and providing personalized experiences at every step of its home buying journey.
Innovation will continue to be at the core of AboitizLand’s culture. In 2022, AboitizLand expects to continue to harvest the results of its digitization strategy and leverage on the Group’s expertise in data science and artificial intelligence. Some key innovation initiatives that are planned for 2022 include the complete automation of the construction management process, the introduction of a new building system/technology, the full roll out of the Vecino (or “neighbor”) app, and the optimization of all digital and social media assets in harnessing leads and strengthening the brand.
AboitizLand remains bullish about the property sector as residential property trends point towards a stronger preference for its residential offerings. There is a newfound appreciation for house and lots and residential lot projects, as preferences for the living set-up shift towards horizontal developments. Supported by the boom of infrastructure developments built by the government, living outside central business districts is now more possible without compromising comfort, convenience, and accessibility. The expected reduction in the need to live near central business districts bodes well for AboitizLand’s residential developments located in emerging centers outside the capital. This trend is expected to continue and will benefit the location of AboitizLand projects that are found in emerging cities outside but still accessible to Metro Manila/Metro Cebu. It is for these reasons that AboitizLand will be launching new phases in its existing projects within 2022.
AboitizLand has allotted ₱2 bn for capital expenditures in 2022.
