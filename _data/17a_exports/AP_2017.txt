Share in net earnings in associates and joint ventures grew by 29% in 2017, as contributions from SN Aboitiz Power-Magat and SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet increased. The improved hydrology experienced by both companies during the first half of 2017 led to higher revenues.
The primary driver of the 25% growth in EBITDA during 2017 was the full year EBITDA contributions of GNPower Mariveles, which was acquired by the Company at the close of 2016.
Supported by increased cash flows from operations and inflows from new loans, the Company continued to infuse capital to its Subsidiaries in 2017 to complete various projects, made timely payments on its obligations, and distributed dividends to its shareholders. During 2017, net outflows relating to financing and investing activities outpaced cash inflow from operations, which led to the ₱11.34 bn decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of year-end 2017.
Current ratio at the end of 2017 was 1.38x, down from end-2016’s 2.25x. This was driven by the 8% decrease in current assets mainly due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents, coupled with a 50% increase in current liabilities as certain long-term debt are expected to fall due in 2018.
Debt-to-equity ratio as of December 31, 2017 was at 1.92:1, down from end-2016’s 2.18:1, as long-term debts were paid down in 2017.

The Company’s net income for 2017 increased to ₱20.42 bn from ₱20.00 bn in 2016, a 2% year-on-year (YoY) increase. This translated to earnings per share of ₱2.77 for 2017. During 2017, the Company recognized non- recurring losses of ₱2.90 bn (versus 2016’s non-recurring loss of ₱611 mn), primarily due to asset impairment costs related to Aseagas and debt prepayment costs on an existing loan of GNPower Mariveles, which were partially offset by a one-off recognition of lower interest expense from an acquired loan. Without these one-off adjustments, the Company’s core net income grew to ₱23.35 bn in 2017 from ₱20.61 bn in 2016, or an increase of 13% YoY.

On a full year basis, the power generation group recorded a consolidated EBITDA share of ₱38.79 bn in 2017, up 27% YoY, and accounted for 83% of the EBITDA contributions from the Company’s business segments. This was driven by the full-year fresh contribution from GNPower Mariveles, and the higher EBITDA of the hydro group as power generation increased during 2017 due to higher water inflows. At the core net income level, the power generation group grew 18% YoY, from ₱17.16 bn in 2016 to ₱20.20 bn in 2017. Non-recurring charges relating to impairment costs, prepayment charges on GNPower Mariveles’ loan upon refinancing, and the one-off recognition of lower interest expense from the foregoing acquired loan, brought the power generation group’s net income contribution in 2017 to ₱17.07 bn.
The Company’s capacity sold increased by 41% YoY, from 2,223 MW in 2016 to 3,124 MW in 2017. This was mainly driven by the additional capacities from GNPower Mariveles, increased generation by its HEPPs, and additional capacities contracted.

The distribution group’s EBITDA increased by 14% YoY, to ₱7.76 bn in 2017. Net income contribution in 2017 increased by 16% YoY to ₱4.27 bn.
The distribution group’s gross margin on a per kWh basis increased by 9% YoY, to ₱1.73 in 2017 from ₱1.59 in 2016. The improved margins were driven by more adequate power supply, better supply mix, and recoveries on purchased power costs.
The distribution group’s attributable sales for 2017 was 5,288 GWh, registering a 4% YoY increase from 2016.
Revenues of the power distribution group decreased by 2% YoY, while the power generation group saw a 61% YoY increase from ₱35.69 bn in 2016 to ₱57.42 bn in 2017. The full year consolidation of the operating revenues of GNPower Mariveles accounted for 96% of the increase in the power generation group’s revenue. The balance of this increase was attributed to higher operating revenues at the small HEPPs (increase of 14% YoY) due to better hydrology in 2017 and the full commercial operations of TSI two units during 2017. The higher operating revenues were partly offset by lower operating revenues at TMI during 2017 as a result of expiring contracts.
In anticipation of the commercial operations of PEC and TVI in 2018, the RES companies progressively entered into contracts throughout 2017, resulting in a ₱9.59 bn increase in operating revenues.

Cost of purchased power increased by ₱6.48 bn during 2017 as RES companies incur higher costs to serve their new contracts.
Cost of generated power increased during 2017 as the costs at GNPower Mariveles were consolidated during the year. This accounted for ₱7.35 bn of the ₱11.24 bn increase in this account for 2017. The balance came from higher cost of steam at APRI, as well as higher fuel costs at the thermal companies due to the price increases on coal and oil during 2017.
All other operating expenses relating to general and administrative expenses, operations and maintenance, and depreciation and amortization increased during 2017 as a result of the full year consolidation of GNPower Mariveles’ expenses.

The decrease in interest income in 2017 was mainly due to lower average cash balances carried at the Parent Company and at its intermediate holding companies, ARI and TPI, during most of the year.

Higher interest expense incurred on TPI’s bridge loan, full year recognition of GNPower Mariveles’ interest expenses, and interest payments made on the Company’s corporate retail bonds led to the 46% YoY increase during 2017 in this account as compared to 2016. This increase was net of lower debt service costs from the Company’s other Subsidiaries, as timely principal payments were made during 2017 on project debts.

The higher volumes sold and ancillary revenues at SN Aboitiz Power-Magat and SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet led to an increase in contributions in 2017 as compared to 2016, as these companies experienced better hydrology in 2017 as compared to very low hydrology during 2016.

The shift from an Other Income position in 2016 to an Other Expense position in 2017 was primarily due to an impairment loss on Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) at Aseagas (₱ 3.13 bn) during 2017, as compared to a non-recurring gain in 2016 relating to supplier settlements.

The increase was due to the full year consolidation of tax provisions taken by GNPower Mariveles.

The increase in this account during 2017 was mainly from the take-up of the minority shareholders’ participation in the income of GNPower Mariveles in 2017.

The movements in cumulative translation adjustments, the share of an associate's unrealized mark-to-market gains on its available-for-sale (AFS) investments, and the recognition of losses and gains on defined benefit plans led to higher comprehensive income recognized for 2017. Total consolidated comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the Parent was ₱20.62 bn for 2017.

Total assets (as of December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016 as restated) increased by ₱4.47 bn or by 1%. The major movements of the accounts leading to the increase were as follows:
(a) Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 24%, or by ₱11.40 bn, during 2017. Cash generated from operations continue to provide significant liquidity for the Company. Long-term debt payments were made during 2017, including approximately ₱16 bn on TPI’s bridge financing obtained in 2016 to fund the acquisitions of GNPower Mariveles and GNPower Dinginin; and ₱2.43 bn as prepayment of Aseagas’ project debt. During 2017, the Company also made timely payments on its other obligations as they became due, and also paid dividends to its shareholders.
(b) Trade and other receivables increased by 12% (from ₱15.47 bn in 2016 to ₱17.36 bn in 2017), due to the increase in receivables as new contracts were signed by the Company’s RES-licensed companies, AESI and AdventEnergy, as well as higher trade receivable balances of the Company’s distribution utilities. The increases noted in the RES companies and distribution utilities constituted 80% of the increase, with the balance mainly coming from higher trade receivables at TLI and TSI.
(c) Inventories increased by 27% (from ₱4.45 bn in 2016 to ₱5.64 bn in 2017) as higher inventory balances as of year-end 2017 were noted at the Company’s thermal plants.
(d) Other current assets increased by ₱40% during 2017, driven mainly by higher prepaid insurance and prepaid taxes of the Company’s Subsidiaries.
(e) At the end of 2017, PPE increased by 6% [from ₱192.98 bn at end-2016 (as restated) to ₱204.03 bn at end- 2017], as various projects entered the final stages of their construction activities, in particular, Hedcor Bukidnon’s hydro project, and TVI and PEC’s coal plants.
(f) The increase in derivative assets (both current and non-current) of the Group by ₱50.08 mn as of end-2017 was driven by fair value changes during the course of 2017.
(g) Net pension assets went up by ₱11 mn, or 24% during 2017, due to the increase in the fair value of plan assets as contributions made during the year.
(h) Due to the refinancing of GNPower Mariveles’ outstanding loan in 2017, previously recognized deferred tax assets relating to the loan were written down, resulting in a 22% decrease in the deferred income tax asset account as of end-2017.
(i) Other non-current assets decreased by 7% as of end-2017, mainly from the Group’s acquisition of Sacasun loan payable during 2017, which offset the Group’s receivables from Sacasun.

Consolidated liabilities decreased by 3%, from ₱244.80 bn as of December 31, 2016 to ₱237.50 bn as of December 31, 2017.
(a) Short term loans increased by 14% or ₱562 mn, mainly from an increase in the number of short-term debts incurred by the distribution utilities to meet working capital requirements.
(b) Trade and other payables increased by 14% or ₱2.45 bn, as payables to suppliers and contractors increased as construction of various power plants continued.
(c) Long-term debt (current and non-current) decreased by ₱7.32 bn (from ₱159.37 bn in 2016 to ₱152.05 bn in 2017). The decrease was mainly due to the ₱15.93 bn prepayment of TPI’s bridge loan obtained in 2016 to fund the acquisition of GNPower Mariveles and GNPower Dinginin, and the ₱2.43 bn prepayment of Aseagas’ project debt. The decrease was net of drawdowns on various project loans and the issuance of the first tranche of corporate retail bonds amounting to ₱3 bn during 2017.
(d) Finance lease obligations (current and non-current) decreased by 6% (from ₱52.34 bn in 2016 to ₱49.22 bn in 2017), as TLI continues to make timely payments to the PSALM on its obligations as IPPA.
(e) Asset retirement obligation account increased as a result of the revaluation of the future obligation on APRI’s asset retirement obligations. The account increased by 62% (from ₱1.82 bn in 2016 to ₱2.96 bn in 2017).
(f) Long term obligation on power distribution system (PDS) decreased by 6%, as regular annual payments were
made in 2017.
(g) Derivative liabilities (current and non-current) decreased by 87% (from ₱361 mn as of December 31, 2016 to ₱ 48 mn as of December 31, 2017) due to the de-recognition of the derivative liability related to the loan prepayment of GNPower Mariveles during 2017.
(h) Customers’ deposits decreased by 11% (from ₱6.83 bn in 2016 to ₱6.09 bn in 2017), as special deposits were refunded by distribution utilities to its customers during 2017.
(i) Other non-current liabilities increased by 20%, driven by an increase of retention payables to suppliers during 2017.
(j) Pension liability increased by 46% (from ₱247 mn in 2016 to ₱361 mn in 2017) on account of additional retirement costs, net of retirement contributions, made by certain Subsidiaries during 2017.
(k) Deferred income tax liabilities (DTL) decreased by 13% (from ₱1.04 bn in 2016 to ₱912 mn in 2017), mainly due to lower deferred tax provisions on unrealized foreign exchange gains and valuation changes recognized during 2017.

Equity attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent increased by 10% (from ₱105.11 bn at year-end 2016 to ₱115.40 bn at year-end 2017) driven mainly by the recognition of income totalling to ₱20.42 bn in 2017, net of dividends declared and paid to the Company’s shareholders.

Cash generated from operations during 2017 were consistent with previous cash flows from operations, bringing in ₱30.24 bn in 2017 as compared to ₱29.89 bn in 2016.
During 2017, the Group's net cash used for investing activities of ₱9.45 bn was used primarily to continue the construction of various power projects. The Group received cash dividends from Associates amounting to ₱5.07 bn during 2017, which provided inflows from investing activities.
In 2017, cash outflows from the payment of long-term debt exceeded cash inflows from availment of long term debt, driven primarily by the Group’s prepayment of ₱2.43 bn for the Aseagas project debt, and approximately ₱16 bn payment on TPI’s bridge loan. During 2017, the Company also raised ₱3.0 bn in corporate retail bonds. Various Subsidiaries also drew down on their project loans, as necessary to bring their respective on-going projects to completion. Net cash outflows for financing activities is ₱32.12 bn during 2017.
As of December 31, 2017, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents decreased by 24%, or from ₱47.09 bn as of year- end 2016 to ₱35.70 bn as of year-end 2017.

Current assets decreased by 8% in 2017 as compared to 2016, accompanied by corresponding increase in current liabilities of 50%. The current ratio as of year-end of 2017 was 1.38x, compared to 2.25x at year-end 2016.
Consolidated debt to equity ratio at year-end 2017 was at 1.92:1, as compared to 2.18:1 as of year-end 2016, owing to the Company’s growth in equity and substantial debt paid down during 2017.


AboitizPower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. Its sound financial condition will give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.

Despite increased competition in the power generation market, AboitizPower believes it has built the foundation to sustain growth over the long term. In line with its growth target of reaching 4,000 MW in net attributable capacity by 2020 from its capacity of 2,999 MW as of December 31, 2017. AboitizPower expects to expand its portfolio of generation assets by implementing the projects described below:

AboitizPower, together with its Subsidiaries and Associates, is in various stages of construction or completion of the following Greenfield and Brownfield projects.
1. 8.5-MW Maris Canal Hydropower Plant Project in Ramon, Isabela. This project, undertaken by SN Aboitiz Power-Magat, was inaugurated in January 2018.
2. 420-MW Pulverized Coal-Fired Expansion Unit 3 in Pagbilao, Quezon. This project is undertaken by PEC, a partnership between TPI, a wholly-owned Subsidiary of AboitizPower, and TPEC Holdings Corporation. PEC started commercial operations in March 2018.
3. 340-MW CFB Coal-Fired Project in Toledo City, Cebu. This project is undertaken by TVI, a partnership between AboitizPower and the Vivant Group. The project involves the construction of a 2x170-MW coal- fired power plant. TVI is targeting commercial operations in May 2018 for Unit 1 and in August 2018 for Unit 2.
4. 68.8-MW Manolo Fortich Hydropower Plant in Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon. The project is undertaken by Hedcor Bukidnon. The completion of Unit 1 (43.4-MW) and Unit 2 (25.4-MW) is expected in April 2018 and in July 2018, respectively.
5. 19-MW La Trinidad Hydropower Plant in La Trinidad, Benguet. This project is undertaken by Hedcor. It is currently under construction and targeted commercial operation date is in the second half of 2019.
6. 2x668-MW Dinginin Supercritical Coal-Fired Power Plant in Mariveles, Bataan. This project is undertaken by GNPower Mariveles, a partnership composed of TPI, AC Energy Holdings, Inc., a wholly- owned subsidiary of Ayala Corporation, and Power Partners Ltd. Co. Both Unit 1 and Unit 2, each of 668- MW, are under construction, with targeted commercial operations expected in June 2019 and July 2020, respectively.

This project, undertaken by SN Aboitiz Power-Ifugao, involves the construction of the 120-MW Alimit hydropower plant, the 250-MW Alimit pumped storage facility, and the 20-MW Olilicon hydropower plant in the municipalities of Aguinaldo, Lagawe, Lamut, and Mayoyao in Ifugao. SN AboitizPower-Ifugao is currently completing the feasibility study phase of the project. The company is also progressing in the permitting process, and is expected to continue working with the government, indigenous peoples' representatives, and industry partners. An important component of the feasibility review for this project is the Free Prior and Informed Consent from the indigenous peoples.

Senator Sergio R. Osmeña III filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to nullify the right-to-top granted by PSALM to SPC in relation to the 153.1 MW NPPC bidding, and to enjoin the award on the ground that SPC’s right- to-top is against public policy.
On February 14, 2017, TPVI, thru counsel, received a copy of the Entry of Judgment from the Supreme Court dated January 9, 2017, stating that its September 28, 2015 Decision declaring the right-to-top as null and void and October 5, 2016 Resolution reinstating the Notice of Award in favor of TPVI, have become final and executory and have been recorded in the Book of Entries of Judgment. With regard to the Motion for Leave to File and Admit the attached
Motion for Reconsideration dated December 9, 2016, and the Supplemental Motion/Petition for Referral to the En Banc dated January 16, 2017 filed by SPC, these were denied by the Supreme Court in a Resolution dated April 26, 2017.

The 660-MW CFB coal-fired power plant located in Redondo Peninsula, Subic, Zambales, is a project undertaken by RP Energy, a joint venture among MPGC, TPI, and TCIC.
On April 20, 2016, RP Energy entered into a PSA with Meralco for a contracted capacity of 225MW within a 20-year term. This PSA was filed for approval with the ERC on April 29, 2016. Public hearings were subsequently held, and were concluded on January 6, 2017. To date, RP Energy is still awaiting the ERC’s PSA approval.

AboitizPower is focused on addressing the needs of its markets, including reliable supply, reasonable cost, and minimal impact on the environment and communities. The Company recognizes that there is no single technology that can address the country’s energy requirements. Thus, AboitizPower believes that a mix of power generation technologies is necessary to address the country’s needs. The Company will continue to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies, where and when it makes sense.

AboitizPower expects that its existing Distribution Utilities will continue to realize modest growth. It continuously seeks efficiency and improvements in its Distribution Utilities’ operations in order to maintain healthy margins.

Performance-Based Rate-setting Regulation (PBR) replaced the Return on Rate Base (RORB) mechanism, that had historically determined the distribution charges paid by customers. Under PBR, distribution utilities can collect rates from customers over a four-year regulatory period.
The ERC has implemented a Performance Incentive Scheme (PIS) whereby annual rate adjustments under PBR are made. The annual rate adjustments take into consideration the ability of a distribution utility to meet or exceed service performance targets set by the ERC, such as: (i) the average duration of power outages; (ii) the average time of restoration to customers; and (iii) the average time to respond to customer calls. The distribution utilities are either rewarded or penalized, depending on their ability to meet these performance targets.
In April 2016, the ERC posted on its website the following documents: (1) Draft Rules for Setting Distribution Wheeling Rates or "RDWR" for Privately Owned Distribution Utilities Operating under Performance Based Regulation, First Entry Group, Fourth Regulatory Period; (2) Draft Position Paper: Regulatory Reset for the July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2019, Fourth Regulatory Period for the First Entry Group of Privately-Owned Distribution Utilities Subject to Performance Based Regulation; and (3) Draft Commission Resolution on the Issues on the Implementation of PBR for Privately Owned DUs under the RDWR. Comments on the said draft documents were submitted to the ERC on May 13, 2016.
Through ERC Resolution No. 25, Series of 2016, dated July 12, 2016, the ERC adopted the “Resolution Modifying the Rules for Setting Distribution Wheeling Rates (RDWR) for Privately Owned Distribution Utilities Entering Performance Based Regulation (PBR)”. Based on this Resolution, the Fourth Regulatory Period shall be as follows:
(ii) Cotabato Light: April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2021
(iii) DavaoLightandVECO:July1,2018toJune30,2022
(iv) SEZandSFELAPCO:October1,2019toSeptember30,2023
On November 21, 2016, the ERC posted the draft “Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) Roll Forward Handbook for Privately Owned Electricity Distribution Utilities” for comments. Public consultations were conducted on January 6 and 9, 2017 in Cebu City and Metro Manila, respectively.

In December 2015, a Petition was filed by Matuwid na Singil sa Kuryente Consumer Alliance, Inc. (MSK) with the ERC wherein MSK proposed a modified RORB methodology or even a modified PBR methodology, in which the distribution utilities’ capital expenditures and rate recovery thereon are approved in advance but the charges to the customers will only start after the investments have actually been made and validated by ERC auditors. Public consultations were set by the ERC on March 17 and April 10, 2017 in its main office, and on March 22 and 24, 2017, in its field offices in Cebu City and Davao City, respectively.
The reset process for the Fourth Regulatory Period has not started for all private distribution utilities as the above- mentioned ERC rules have not been published, which is a condition for their effectivity. Due to the rules change on PBR, all Distribution Utilities of AboitizPower have not undergone the Third Regulatory Period.

In 2015, the DOE issued Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, entitled “Mandating all Distribution Utilities to Undergo Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in securing Power Supply Agreements (PSA).” The DOE recognizes that CSP in the procurement of PSAs by the distribution utilities ensures long term security and certainty of electricity prices of electric power to end-users.
On November 4, 2015, the ERC issued Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015, entitled "A Resolution Directing All Distribution Utilities to Conduct a Competitive Selection Process in the Procurement of their Supply in the Captive Market".
The adoption and implementation of the CSP is expected to increase transparency and competition in power supply contracting. The impact of CSP is prospective and, as such, its effectivity will not affect AboitizPower’s existing contracts.
On February 9, 2018, the DOE issued Department Circular No. DC2018-02-0003, essentially modifying the existing policy on CSP of power supply contracting, applicable to both electric cooperatives and private distribution utilities. Distribution utilities are now mandated to create either an independent five-man third party bids and awards committee (TPBAC) that will manage their CSP supply procurements, or have a third party auctioneer (TPA). The TPBAC and the TPA shall be accountable to its decision in the conduct of the CSP.
If a TPBAC is established, it shall be comprised of five (5) members, three (3) of whom shall be officers and/or employees of the distribution utility, and two (2) members shall be captive customers that are not directly or indirectly connected/affiliated with the distribution utility.
If the relevant distribution utility opts to have a TPA to undertake CSP in its procurement of power supply, the TPA shall be composed of a team of private individuals or a private corporation duly recognized in the Philippines with expertise on competitive bidding and with sufficient knowledge of the electric power industry. The TPA should not be connected/affiliated either directly or indirectly with the relevant distribution utility. The accreditation of potential TPAs is handled by the ERC.

On December 30, 2017, the DOE issued Department Circular No. DC2017-12-0015, or the “Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) On-Grid Rules”. The new policy mandates distribution utilities, RES, generation companies supplying directly connected customers, and other mandated energy sector participants (each, a “Mandated Participant”) to source or produce a certain percentage share of their energy mix from eligible renewable energy (RE) facilities. Under the new policy, eligible RE facilities include the following technologies: biomass, waste-to-energy technology, wind, solar, hydro, ocean, geothermal, and such other RE technologies that may be later identified by the DOE.
The new policy mandates identified energy sector participants to comply with minimum annual RPS requirement in order to meet an “aspirational target” of 35% renewable energy supply in the generation mix by the year 2030. The RPS guidelines will implement a Minimum Annual Increment RE Percentage to be sold to mandated participants, initially set at 1% of the net electricity sales of the mandated participant for the previous year. Furthermore, this Minimum Annual Increment RE Percentage will be used to determine the current year’s requirement for RE Certificates (RECs) of the Mandated Participant. RE sourcing shall be enforced on the third year from the issuance of the DOE Circular in the year 2020, with the period 2018-2019 considered as the transition phases to project developments.
The RPS On-Grid Rules, which shall be implemented nationwide, also envisions the creation of an RE market where mandated participants comply with the Minimum Annual RPS Requirement through the allocation, generation, purchase or acquisition, or generation from net-metering arrangements, of RE Certificates. The RE Certificates will represent 1 MWh of generation produced from an eligible RE facility. Furthermore, all Mandated Participants must undertake a CSP in sourcing RE generation supply for its customers.

In February 2018, the ERC issued Resolution No. 20, Series of 2017 (ERC Resolution No. 20-2017) entitled “A Resolution Adopting the ERC Rules for Setting the Distribution System Loss Cap and Establishing Performance Incentive Scheme for Distribution Efficiency”. This set of rules provide for the new Distribution System Loss (DSL) cap that can be recovered and charged by distribution utilities to its customers, beginning in the May 2018 billing period. Private distribution utilities shall charge a 6.50% DSL cap for 2018, which shall be reduced gradually on an annual basis until a DSL cap level of 5.50% is achieved by the year 2021. The aforementioned caps are exclusive of sub-transmission and substation losses.
Thereafter, the Private Electric Power Operators Association (PEPOA) wrote a letter to the ERC seeking for a one year delay of the effectivity of the recoverable rate under the new DSL cap, to the May 2019 billing period. With the additional year, the member distribution utilities could make the appropriate upgrades to their distribution systems for cost-effective system loss reduction measures, and ultimately, achieve efficient operation of their utilities. These capital expenditure projects such as upgrading transformers or primary and secondary voltage distribution lines, require careful planning, implementation, and ERC approval. These material and physical changes to distribution systems cannot be achieved in two months.
AboitizPower is considering the filing of individualized system loss applications to the ERC, where justifiable for a particular Distribution Utility. The foregoing ERC Resolution 20-2017 provides that a distribution utility may elect to use an alternative method in determining its applicable individualized DSL cap. The Company believes that costs and benefits must be analyzed from the viewpoint of the customer determining the reasonable level of individualized DSL cap.
In February 2018, the Philippine Senate passed a bill setting the recoverable system loss rate for the private distribution utilities at 5%. Meanwhile, the Philippine House of Representatives is conducting technical working group meetings to gather inputs from industry stakeholders.

DOE Circular No. 2015-06-0010 and ERC Resolutions 5, 10 and 11, Series of 2016, are all subject of a Petition for Declaratory Relief filed by Meralco with the Regional Trial Court of Pasig (the “Pasig RTC”) in June 2016 (the “Petition”). On July 13, 2016, the Pasig RTC has issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the DOE and ERC from implementing the aforementioned Circular and Resolutions, insofar as relating to the prohibition on distribution utilities from engaging in the supply business, and the imposition of restrictions, contract term limits, mandatory contestability, and market caps.
On September 21, 2016, the DOE filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition to the Supreme Court praying, among others, for the nullification of all Orders and Decisions issued by the Pasig RTC. The Supreme Court issued a Resolution on October 10, 2016 granting a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the Pasig RTC from enforcing its decisions, orders, and resolutions related to the Petition until its final resolution.
On November 15, 2016, the ERC issued Resolution No. 28, Series of 2016, revising the timeframe of mandatory contestability from December 26, 2016 to February 26, 2017.
On February 21, 2017, the Supreme Court issued a TRO in relation to the petition to stop the implementation of the new regulations imposing mandatory contestability filed by Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry San Beda College Alabang Inc., Ateneo de Manila University, and Riverbanks Development Corporation before the Supreme Court in December 2016. The TRO enjoined the ERC and the DOE from implementing ERC Resolutions No. 5, 10, 11, and 28, Series of 2016, and DOE Circular No. 2015-06-0010.

On May 4, 2017, the DOE issued DC 2017-05-0009 entitled “Declaring the Launch of WESM in Mindanao and Providing Transition Guidelines”. This DOE Circular took effect on June 7, 2017, with the following pertinent provisions:
1. Establishment of Mindanao WESM Transition Committee, which will be one of the committees under the Philippine Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC) Board;
2. Launch of WESM in Mindanao on June 26, 2017, with the commencement of full commercial operations dependent on various conditions precedent, including installation of metering facilities, approval of the Price Determination Methodology by the ERC, and trial operations of the WESM, among others;

On December 2, 2013, the DOE issued Department Circular No. DC2013-12-0027 entitled: “Declaring the Commercial Launch for the Trading of Ancillary Service in Luzon and Visayas under the Philippine Wholesale Electricity Spot Market". This DOE Circular sets the responsibility of the PEMC, National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), National Electrification Administration, and all WESM members in relation to the operation of the Reserve Market (market that basically provides back-up power that could be tapped by the NGCP). As of this writing, no date has been set for the launch of the Reserve Market.
Pending the ERC’s approval of the Price Determination Methodology of the Reserve Market, the DOE and PEMC implemented the Central Dispatch and Scheduling of Energy and Reserves in the WESM starting January 2016. The protocol follows that of the Reserve Market, with participants being only those contracted with NGCP, and that no settlement amount will come from the WESM.

On May 2017, the DOE approved the new FIT-All rate for 2016 at ₱0.1830/kWh. The new FIT-All rate for 2016 took effect in the immediately succeeding billing period following the receipt by National Transmission Corporation of the aforementioned decision.
In March 2017, the ERC issued Resolution No. 01, Series of 2017, entitled “Resolution Setting the Degressed Feed-In Tariff Rates for Run-of-River Hydro and Biomass, as provided in Section 2.11 of the Feed-In Tariff Rules (FIT Rules)”. The degressed rates will be applied for run-of-river hydro and biomass plants which commenced commercial operations in the period January to December 2017. The degressed rate for hydro is ₱5.8705/kWh, and ₱6.5969/kWh for biomass.

The DOE, through the National Renewable Energy Board (NREB), aims to release the final rules for the Green Energy Option (GEOP) in 2018. The NREB has conducted several public consultations nationwide as part of the requirements for the approval of the policy.
Under the GEOP, electricity end-customers will be allowed to access renewable energy resources through their distribution utility, electric cooperatives, or electricity suppliers. The NREB is expected to submit its output on the policy to the DOE for the latter’s review and eventual promulgation.
