The Bank’s base case scenario forecasts 2022 Philippine GDP growth of 6.5%, an improvement compared to the 5.6% growth reported in 2021. The acceleration in this year’s GDP growth is underpinned by broadening consumption activity as government policymakers signal a further easing of Covid-19 quarantine protocols. The 2022 GDP outlook also incorporates expectations of continued resilience in the economic contributions of overseas worker remittances and the business process outsourcing sector
A continuation of the Philippine economic recovery into this year, however, assumes that expanding vaccine coverage reduces risks of severe outcomes from Covid-19 infections. Otherwise, policymakers may be forced to delay the easing of restrictions. It is also assumed that inflation headwinds are largely limited to the early part of 2022, with commodity price base effects to eventually normalize over the course of the full year.
Downside risks that may hinder the recovery include potential delays in vaccine procurement and the immunization timetable, vaccine resistant Covid-19 variants, and geopolitical events that can cause unexpected spikes in commodity prices and accelerate inflation. The upcoming May 2022 Philippine Presidential election may also raise uncertainties regarding the trajectory of government economic policy.
