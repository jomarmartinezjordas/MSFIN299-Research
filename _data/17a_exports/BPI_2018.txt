Bank premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment, net increased by P1.2 billion, or 7.9% due to land and building premises, renovations and leasehold improvements.

The Bank’s loan portfolio mix is broken down into large corporates at 76%, SMEs at 6%, and consumer at 18% as compared to last year’s 74%, 7%, and 19%, respectively.
In January 2018, the Bank adopted the expected credit loss (ECL) models required under the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS 9) as the basis for the provisioning for loan losses. Reporting under this new standard, allowance for Impairment of P22.9 billion was up by P2.2 billion from last year’s P20.7 billion and also higher than 2016’s P18.7 billion.
The Bank also adopted BSP Circular No. 941 which amended regulations on past due and nonperforming loans (NPL). Under this new reporting classification, the Bank ended the year with an NPL ratio of 1.85%. Prior years December 2017 and December 2016 followed BSP circular 772 (30-day net NPL ratio, net of fully reserved accounts) and ended at the same ratio of 0.5%. The Bank’s NPL ratio was slightly below industry average of 1.81% as of December 2018.
BPI shall prudently manage its lending activity and will always be mindful of the credit risks, potential or otherwise, that may be posed by the shifting environment. It will regularly assess its portfolio quality and ensure adequate collateral and reserve coverage. It will continue to resolve outstanding delinquent loans through collection or restructuring, where appropriate.

Despite tightness in system liquidity in 2018, BPI still derived 90% of its funding from deposits. Compared to the 95% in 2017, the 5% shift in mix is attributable to the increase in other borrowings, namely, the Bank’s issuance of USD600 million in senior unsecured bonds in August 2018, and the issuance of P25 billion in peso fixed rate bonds in December 2018.

Its loan to deposit ratio was 85% in 2018, up from 77% in 2017.

The Bank’s net income from 2016 to 2018 increased by a CAGR of 8.2% as net interest income and non-interest income increased by 13.1% and 3.1%, respectively. However, these improvements in revenues were partly reduced by the higher impairment losses and operating expenses whose 3-year CAGRs were up 7.4% and 11.0%, respectively.

For the year 2018, the Bank earned a net income of P23.1 billion, representing a P661.3 million, or 3.0% increase relative to P22.4 billion earned in 2017. This increase was driven by the P7.5 billion growth in revenues, which was partly tempered by the increase in operating expenses and impairment losses by P5.1 billion, or 13.2%, and P1.1 billion, or 29.7%, respectively.
Net interest income of P55.8 billion increased 16.2% from last year’s P48.0 billion on the back of P158.0 billion average asset base expansion.
Interest income increased P14.3 billion, or 21.8%, to P80.2 billion from previous year’s P65.8 billion. Interest income on loans and advances increased by P14.8 billion, or 27.1%, as both the loan average volume and yield rose by P173.9 billion, and 48 bps, respectively. Interest income on financial assets grew P430 million also due to the increase in average volume and yield of P11.6 billion and 34 bps, respectively. On the other hand, interest income on deposits with BSP and other banks declined by P876 million, or 42.8%, due to decline in both average volume and yield by P41.5 million, and 37 bps, respectively.
Interest expense of P24.3 billion increased P6.5 billion, or 36.7%, from last year’s P17.8 billion. Interest expense on deposits increased P4.9 billion or 29.3% as both the average deposit base and cost grew by P67.5 billion and 18 bps, respectively. Interest expense on bills payable and other borrowings also increased P1.7 billion, or 144.4%, due to higher volume and cost attributable to the new bond issuances in 2018.
Other income at P22.7 billion, was lower by P300 million, or 1.3%, from P23.0 billion last year. The drop in other income was accounted for by the P264 million, or 22.1%, decline in trading gain on securities due to market volatility. Income attributable to insurance operations also decreased by the P190 million, or 13.5%, due to the life insurance subsidiary’s lower investment income arising from mark-to- market losses and the non-life business’ higher claims expenses. On the positive, fees and commissions increased by P572 million, or 6.9%, on increased service charges.
Other expenses at P43.6 billion, increased P5.1 billion, or 13.2% from last year’s P38.5 billion. Other operating expenses increased P1.8 billion, or 13.9%, on product-related insurance premiums, rewards and other selling expenses, third party fees and commissions, and transaction related costs. Occupancy and equipment-related expenses grew by P1.8 billion, or 15.9% owing to increase in rental, depreciation and amortization costs, and significant spending on IT-related services. Compensation and fringe benefits also increased at P15.3 billion, up by P1.4 billion, or 10.2% on account of BanKo’s manpower expansion for its new offices.
Impairment losses stood at P4.9 billion, P1.1 billion, or 29.7% higher than the previous year, due to increased loan loss provisioning.
Provision for income tax at P6.7 billion, up P714 million, or 12.0% increase from P6.0 billion last year. Current taxes rose by P986 million, or 15.4%, due to higher core intermediation fees subject to regular corporate income tax. Deferred taxes decreased P272 million, or 58.8% on account of the impairment losses set up for the year, and accounts with timing difference.
Income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased P68 million, or 21.4%, on account of lower income from the Bank’s non-life insurance and leasing subsidiaries.

Total comprehensive income was at P21.9 billion, P529 million, or 2.4% lower than last year’s P22.4 billion as other comprehensive income declined P1.3 billion, overshadowing the increase in net income before minority interest of P593 million.
Net change in fair value reserve on FVOCI securities, net of tax effect decreased P1.5 billion or 210.8% on account of lower market valuation of the Bank’s investment securities. Currency translation differences likewise decreased by P152 million, or 120.3% due to the general weakening of the Philippine peso. Fair value reserve on investments of insurance subsidiaries, also decreased by P596 million, or 303.8%, as a result of lower market valuation of the insurance subsidiaries’ investment funds. Share in other comprehensive loss of associates decreased P1.0 billion, or 408.2% due to the downward market valuation of the investments of the bancassurance affiliate. These decreases were partly tempered by the P885 million, or 324.6% increase in actuarial gains (losses) on defined benefit plan, net of tax effect as impacted by the change in financial assumption; and the P1.1 billion, or 212.7% increase in share in other comprehensive gain (loss) of associates due to the remeasurement/fair valuation of BPI-Philam’s liabilities, property, and equipment.
Comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased P150 million, or 48.0% due to lower market valuation of the insurance’s subsidiaries’ investments.

The Bank’s key financial performance ratios for the last three years showed consistent profitability and adequate capitalization. The same ratios are also used to evaluate the performance of the bank’s subsidiaries.
Return on equity (ROE), the ratio of net income to average equity at 10.2% was lower, compared to last year’s 12.7% due to the faster growth in average equity at 28.6% versus growth in net income of 3.0%.
Return on assets (ROA), the ratio of net income to average assets, also improved to 1.2%, was slightly lower than 2017 at 1.3% due to faster growth in average assets at 9.0% as compared to growth in net income.
Net interest margin (NIM), the ratio of net interest income to average interest bearing assets, at 3.1%, improved by 21 basis points on the combined impact of the increase in yields and growth in average interest earning assets.
Operating efficiency (cost to income) ratio, the ratio of operating expenses to income, increased to 55.5% from last year’s 54.3% as increase in operating expenses outpaced revenue growth.
Capital adequacy ratio (CAR), computed using the standard risk weights assigned to the Bank’s assets compared with its qualifying capital, measures the capability of Bank’s capital funds to cover its various business risks. The Bank’s CAR under the Basel III framework was recorded at 16.1% versus 12.7% in the previous year, due to the increase in qualifying capital, on account of the May 2018 SRO. This year’s CAR and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratios remained above the BSP requirements. The Bank’s capital is composed largely of CET 1 capital.

Other than the disclosure enumerated above, the Bank has nothing to report on the following:
a) Any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will have a material impact on its liquidity.
b) Events that will trigger direct or contingent financial obligation that is material to the company, including any default or acceleration of an obligation.
c) Material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), and other relationships of the bank with unconsolidated entities or other persons created during the reporting period.
d) Any material commitments for capital expenditures.
e) Any known trends, events or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably expected to have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales/revenues/income from continuing operations.

The Philippine economy may expand by at least 6.5% in 2019 on the back of a sustained surge in capital goods spending. Should oil prices stabilize in 2019, growth may even accelerate further as household spending is expected to recover from the 2018 slowdown and as overall spending activity picks up ahead of the May 2019 mid-term elections. On the production side, the construction industry may benefit from the government’s “Build, Build, Build” program, especially if the groundbreaking of big ticket projects (Subway, airport, etc.) finally kicks in this year.
A manageable widening of the trade deficit is expected to translate to a modest depreciation of the Philippine Peso with additional pressure from global trade disputes and financial market volatility among major markets.
Inflation is expected to return to the 2.0% to 4.0% target in 2019 as a result of moderating global oil prices. BSP is expected to keep its policy rate steady at 4.75% throughout 2019 and will likely prioritize a minimum 2 percentage point reduction of the ratio of required reserves on deposits (RRR) of commercial and universal banks.

Against the backdrop of a stabilizing scenario in 2019, the Bank is poised to take advantage of the recovery in household and overall spending. With inflation decelerating to within BSP targets, the Bank has been prudent and strategic in maximizing the window of favorable loan repricing.
In 2017, there was an intentional slowdown in the Bank’s consumer lending business growth to focus on improving internal processes and developing internal systems. In particular, these improvements covered innovative auto and housing loan facilities, highly automated loan processing systems, and prudent risk management. With the new and improved processes in place, the Bank is now better equipped to expand its retail loans base, rising to meet the demand for primary homes and vehicles of the growing young middle class. In light of the mid-term election spending, the Bank’s newly created Business Banking segment is ready to service the unique financial needs of the Bank’s SME clients, particularly those suppliers of campaign and electoral materials. Moreover, the Bank’s Corporate segment continues to provide a full suite of banking products to large corporates and multinationals, not only to those involved in the government’s Build, Build, Build program.
To manage our exposure to market volatility and currency fluctuation while capturing opportunities, the Bank’s Treasury arm has various strategies. The foreign exchange desk has been steadily shifting from trading to proprietary flows while the Bank’s recent USD bond issuance also allows for a more diverse funding profile to match our clients’ foreign currency needs. The Bank’s Remittances desk has also introduced new services to complement the Overseas Filipinos’ natural activity in foreign exchange markets.
In light of the current system liquidity tightness, one of the Bank’s top priorities is Current Account and Savings Account (CASA) growth. To improve CASA deposits, a dual-pronged approach will be employed: (1) capitalizing on the Bank’s extensive physical and digital distribution network, and (2) continuing to provide innovative deposit-based products to acquire new clients and attract deposits.
Branch network expansion will be in key areas where the Bank previously has no presence, which show potential for increasing consumer spending and infrastructure investments. This expansion will be balanced and complemented by the outlays in the Bank’s digital infrastructure for more efficient digitalized banking processes that will spur financial inclusion in the country.

Household consumption and investment spending may continue to drive economic growth in the coming years. The country has a young population that supports consumer demand, thereby preventing a situation similar to aging countries where growth is sluggish. Capital spending from the private sector is expected to remain substantial given the need to expand the productive capacity of corporates in order to meet rising consumer demand.
However, a crucial element in the country’s long term development is the improvement in public infrastructure. Economic activity will be constrained if transport and logistics costs remain high. The government’s infrastructure initiatives will allow the economy to grow at a faster rate in the long run.
To capitalize on the Philippines’ stable economic growth, the Bank’s medium term strategic imperatives focus on financial inclusion and digitalization.
The Bank’s microfinance arm, BanKo, was created to contribute to the nation’s prosperity by reaching out to a wider swath of the population, recognizing the need for the unbanked market to have access to credit. Primarily a platform to serve Self-Employed Micro-Entrepreneurs (SEMEs), the Bank has begun to provide these clients with affordable and appropriate financial products and services, and empowering them with financial advice and solutions that promote the growth and expansion of their enterprises.
The Bank recognizes the importance of building strong digital capabilities both in digital distribution platforms to exponentially increase client access points, and also in the back office to increase productivity and automation, as well as reduce costs. Significant investments have been made in the following key areas: (1) developing an omni-channel experience, (2) providing a 360-degree view of the client, (3) implementing a workforce retraining program, (4) focusing on cybersecurity, and (5) building resiliency. Digitalization will be the Bank’s core focus over the next five years, with the aim of continuously enhancing overall customer experience, and maintain a cost advantage over other banks in the Philippines.
