Net interest margin (NIM), net interest income divided by average interest bearing assets, at 3.3% was higher by 24 basis points from last year’s 3.1% on account of the 69-basis point increase in loan yields, tempered by the 52-basis point increase in cost of funds.

The Philippine economy expanded by 5.9% in 2019, below the 6-7% target of the government. Despite the strength of household consumption, delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects and the decline in investment spending dragged growth below the 6% level. For 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has become the greatest challenge for the global and domestic economies. It is clear that the outbreak will have a negative impact on the economy. However, quantifying the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Philippine economy is difficult given the uniqueness of the event.

Household consumption recovered in 2019 as inflation slowed down. Stable oil prices and sufficient rice supply pulled down average inflation from 5.2% in 2018 to 2.5% in 2019. Household consumption will likely continue to be the main driver of growth in the medium term with support from OFW remittances and record-low unemployment. However, the enhanced community quarantine in various parts of the economy has crippled household consumption to an extent not seen since the early 1980s.

Capital formation contracted in 2019 for the first time in 7 years as demand for machinery and equipment declined. Corporates may have postponed or scaled down the purchase of durable equipment given the elevated global growth uncertainties and expectations of lower interest rates in the coming months. Meanwhile, public construction posted a 2.4% contraction as a result of government underspending. The budget impasse and election spending ban in the first half of the year prevented the government from spending on new infrastructure projects. Looking ahead, capital expenditures may fall as business will most likely prioritize their liquidity to sustain themselves and their employees amid the measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Among the 3 major sectors of the economy, services outperformed in 2019 with 7.1% growth. Retail trade grew at a faster pace with the help of lower inflation, while financial intermediation recorded higher growth given wider interest margins and trading gains resulting from the bond market rally. The industry sector slowed down amid the weakness in manufacturing and construction. Global trade uncertainties weighed down manufacturing growth despite the stability shown by household consumption. In 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak may hurt several industries given the restrictions on movement and economic activity. In particular, the following industries may see a decline in economic output and revenues: tourism, airline, real estate, transport, and manufacturing.

Low inflation in 2019 gave the BSP the opportunity to revert its policy stance from tightening to monetary easing. Given the liquidity and growth challenges being faced by the economy, the Monetary Board reduced the policy rate by 75 bps from 4.75% to 4.00% and brought down the reserve requirement ratio (“RRR”) by 400 bps from 18% to 14% in 2019. Benchmark interest rates declined as liquidity improved gradually.
The BSP has reduced the policy rate by another 75 bps so far and may resume its monetary easing in 2020 given the economic damage that COVID-19 could bring. The enhanced community quarantine may squeeze liquidity amid the lack of spending and the need for savings in this time of crisis. As a result, the central bank may inject liquidity into the financial system through its monetary policy tools such as open market operations and further reduction in the reserve requirement on deposits.
Meanwhile, global risk aversion due to COVID-19 may fuel the demand for safe haven like the US Dollar. Emerging market currencies like the Philippine Peso may weaken as investors shift their funds to assets that could protect them from the impact of COVID-19. However, the possible decline in imports and remittances due to supply disruptions may temper the depreciation pressure from risk aversion.

Against this backdrop, BPI and the entire banking industry play a major role in the economic recovery of the country. BPI remains focused on prudently accelerating growth in the higher-margin SME and consumer lending businesses, which will be hardest hit by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Bank has already announced a 90-day deferral in loan payments to doctors, nurses and other medical workers as well as policemen and soldiers to provide financial relief during the COVID-19 lockdown. BSP has also offered relief measures, notably, to Banks such as staggered recognition of provisioning, and a 30-day grace period for loan payments.
BPI also maintains strength in the corporate segment, which comprises 75% of its loan portfolio. We strive to be the main operating bank for our clients, especially those bounce-back industries and companies, while evaluating what assistance can be provided to clients in affected sectors such as tourism, hospitality, transport, and retail trade and manufacturing.
The current environment also requires that we continue to place emphasis on managing risks by enhancing our credit process in the aspects of underwriting, monitoring, and collections, in consideration of the COVID-19 impact. With the depth and length of the disruption still uncertain, we are monitoring asset quality given the expected rise in NPLs, that could potentially approximate prior crisis levels. We shall also monitor the vulnerable industries and sectors that will be most affected by COVID-19, at the same time, identify opportunities in other industries and sectors as a result of the change in economic behaviors post-crisis.
Liquidity is also a top priority for BPI, raising P15.3 billion in a 2-year bond issuance on January 13, 2020 and P33.9 billion in a 1.5-year bond issuance on March 27, 2020, completed before the Luzon lockdown. The Bank proceeds with an invigorated focus on CASA deposit growth in the near-term.
Reinforcing the Bank’s operational resilience during this health crisis, BPI has put in motion business continuity plans and a pandemic response plan and protocol for the entire organization. The objective of our pandemic response plan is three-fold: (1) ensure continuous delivery of products and services to our customers and the banking public, (2) ensure the health and well-being of our employees, and (3) cooperate with authorities in their efforts to contain transmission. BPI has select branches and critical units open, some with modified physical layouts and protective screens to observe social distancing, while the rest of the skeletal work force operate in home/remote site arrangements.
The Bank recognizes the importance of building strong digital capabilities, which was tested during the enhanced community quarantine, via our digital distribution platforms to increase client access points, how we could enhance overall customer experience, as well as in the back office infrastructure to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Significant investments have been made around the five pillars of our digital ecosystem: (1) omni-channel experience, (2) customer experience, (3) high tech, high touch channels, (4) open banking, and (5) cybersecurity and privacy. At this point in time, we seek to accelerate the shift to digital, enabling us to deliver a convenient and frictionless banking experience for our clients. We are also maximizing our use of technology to enable work continuity without physical proximity.
The success of all of these efforts will contribute to a more sustainable business and, under favorable market conditions, recovery and growth of our share price.
