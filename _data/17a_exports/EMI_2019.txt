On the local front, Emperador Brandy remains the nationwide leader, particularly in key metro cities, amid fierce competition among local brands. Emperador introduced a lighter brandy, Emperador Double Light in July 2019 and a bundle pairing ‘Apple of My Light’ in August 2019.

The blended malts further boosted sales.
