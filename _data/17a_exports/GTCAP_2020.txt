and impairment losses as a result of proactive measures to better prepare the Bank for risks associated with the
pandemic;

EQUITY

Other comprehensive loss improved by Php1.17 billion from Php2.02 billion to Php0.85 billion primarily due to the mark-to-market gain on financial assets at FVOCI of the Group.
Non-controlling interest (NCI) decreased by 25% from Php11.85 billion to Php8.88 billion largely due to the declaration of cash dividends by subsidiaries which are not wholly-owned.

Metrobank consolidated net income declined by 50.7% from Php28.1 billion in 2019 to Php13.8 billion in 2020. This was primarily due to provisions for credit and impairment losses booked in 2020 amounting to Php40.8 billion, which is four times more than the Php10.1 billion booked in 2019.
Net interest income grew by 11.8% from Php77.0 billion in 2019 to Php86.1 billion in 2020, comprising 71.0% of total operating income. CASA deposits increased by 21.7% from Php1.1 trillion to Php1.3 trillion, which resulted in CASA ratio improvement from 62.9% in 2019 to 73.0% of total deposits in 2020.
Non-interest income grew by 20.9% from Php29.1 billion in 2019 to Php35.1 billion in 2020 on account of increases in trading and securities, and foreign exchange gains partially offset by lower fee-based income and miscellaneous income.
Total assets grew slightly by 0.2% from Php2.45 trillion as of December 31, 2019 to Php2.46 trillion as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in cash and other cash items, due from BSP, interbank loans receivable and SPURA, investment securities and deferred tax assets, partially offset by decreases in loans and receivables, due from other banks, investments in associates and JV and other assets.
Total liabilities, fell by 0.5% from Php2.13 trillion as of December 31, 2019 to Php2.12 trillion due mainly to increases in deposit liabilities, derivative liabilities and bonds payable partially offset by decreases in bills payable and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements, manager’s checks and demand drafts outstanding, income taxes payable, accrued interest and other expenses and subordinated debts.
Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company grew by 4.7% from Php309.6 billion as of December 30, 2019 to Php324.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 due to the net effect of the net income reported during the year and improvement in net unrealized gain on FVOCI.

Federal Land’s reservation sales amounted to Php14.2 billion in 2020, declining from Php24.2 billion in 2019 as potential buyers postponed the purchase of properties amid the pandemic.
Real estate sales and revenues declined by 34.3% and 29.7%, respectively, due to slower construction growth and sales take-up of projects arising from the community quarantine restrictions and delayed equity collections in support of the Bayanihan Act. This has also affected the net income attributable to equity holders of the parent which reached Php0.6 billion in 2020.
Total assets grew from Php92.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 to Php109.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. The asset expansion was mainly driven by increases in inventories as a result of land banking and receivables from real estate buyers.

On July 4, 2019, the Philippine Competition Commission approved the redemption of PCFI shares in exchange for selected assets. The resulting profit after taxes from the operations of PCFI from January to June 2019 and the gain on redemption of PCFI shares amounted to Php3.81 billion.

TMP’s consolidated sales fell from Php168.6 billion in 2019 to Php99.8 billion in 2020 as wholesales volume declined by 40.1% from 163,493 units to 97,863 units. TMP retail sales volume also decreased by 38.3% from 162,011 units to 100,019 units. Retail sales volume, however, was slightly better than industry’s performance which saw a 40.1% volume decline from 410,035 to 241,924 units. As a result, TMP market share improved from 39.5% in 2019 to 41.3% in 2020, driven by the Vios, Hilux, and Wigo.
In 2020, TMP maintained its auto dealership complement of 71 outlets with no new openings for the year.
The overall financial performance of TMP was largely driven by the Taal eruption and the community quarantine restrictions in 2020. Decline in demand for vehicles caused net income to drop from Php9.1 billion in 2019 to Php3.3 billion in 2020. Other than lower vehicle sales, the overall slowdown in the economy also affected consumer behavior with some households deferring vehicle purchases or opting for lower-priced models. On the contrary, we have seen improved demand for passenger cars as public modes of transport became limited, shifting the overall mix to smaller and lower-priced models. Also, demand for spare parts declined in line with the economic contraction. These drivers were offset by favorable forex movement as the US dollar remained weak over the year.
As of December 31,2020, TMP directly owns seven (7) dealer outlets namely Toyota Makati with one (1) branch Toyota Bicutan, Toyota San Fernando in Pampanga with two (2) branches in Plaridel Bulacan and Toyota Tarlac in Tarlac City, Lexus Manila, situated in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City and Toyota Santa Rosa, situated in Sta. Rosa, Laguna.

Consolidated sales, comprising of vehicle sales, spare parts and maintenance services, decreased by 43.9% from Php23.6 billion in 2019 to Php13.2 billion in 2020. The decrease was driven significantly by the decline in vehicle sales by 44.6% from Php21.5 billion to Php11.9 billion, which accounted for 90.1% of TMBC’s revenues. Such was the result of the decline in penetration rate from 11.0% to 10.7%.
Retail sales volume decreased by 39.7% from 17,755 to 10,709 units driven by Vios, Innova and Hiace. Sales from spare parts and maintenance services, accounting for a combined 9.8% of revenues, decreased by 37%.
Consolidated net income decreased by 97.5% from Php224.3 million in 2019 to Php5.4 million in 2020 due to the overall decline in revenues resulting from a decreased demand for vehicles and services.
TMBC currently owns five (5) dealer outlets namely Toyota Manila Bay, Toyota Abad Santos, Toyota Cubao and Toyota Marikina, all situated within Metro Manila; and Toyota Dasmariñas in Cavite.

TFSPC recorded a 7.3% growth in gross interest income from Php7.0 billion in 2019 to Php7.5 billion in 2020, as finance receivables increased by 23.8% from Php75.4 billion to Php93.4 billion on a year-on-year basis.
Booking volume, increased by 18.1% from 34,039 units in 2019 to 40,212 units in 2020 despite the overall decline in TMP’s sales volume due to higher penetration rate from 21.0% to 40.2%.
Net income, however, declined by 77.5% at Php130.4 million due to higher provisions for credit losses and increased ROPA losses arising from the pandemic.

SMFC recorded a 8.1% growth in gross interest income from Php1.7 billion in 2019 to Php1.8 billion in 2020, as average yields increased on a year-on-year basis. Bookings, however, declined by 37.5% from 65,505 units in 2019 to 40,943 units in 2020.
Net income fell by 78.3% from Php354.8 in 2019 to Php77.2 billion in 2020 due to the community quarantine restrictions that resulted in higher provisions for credit losses.

New business from life insurance expressed in Annualized Premium Equivalent declined by 23.6% from Php6.8 billion in 2019 to Php5.2 billion in 2020. Such was driven by the 36.3% decline in Regular Premium, partially offset by the 55.3% growth in Single Premium. The lower sales production was attributable to the limited mobility of agents and lower foot traffic in banks as an effect of the quarantine restrictions. Premium revenues increased by 19.1% from Php26.5 billion in 2019 to Php31.6 billion in 2020 as the premium revenue mix changed from 36%/64% (Single Premium vs. Regular Premium) in 2019 to 46%/54% in 2020. By distribution platform, bancassurance, sales agency and corporate solutions accounted for 63%, 33% and 4% of premium revenues, respectively.
Gross written premiums of the non-life insurance declined from Php5.4 billion in 2019 to Php3.9 billion in 2020. The quarantine restrictions resulted in limited mobility, lower consumer spending and ban in travels which affected sales across all lines of business.

Consolidated net income grew by 22.4% from Php2.4 billion in 2019 to Php2.9 billion in 2020. The improvement in consolidated net income is attributable to non-life insurance business which reported a net income of Php0.1 billion in 2020 from a net loss of Php1.0 billion in 2019 due to lower claims and losses, reinsurance cost and management expenses. Conversely, AXA Philippines’s net income declined from Php3.4 billion in 2019 to Php2.8 billion in 2020 due to lower premium margins from the shortfall in sales in Regular Premium products and unrealized losses in equity investments.

MPIC’s share in the consolidated operating core income decreased by 26% from Php20.9 billion in 2019 to Php15.4 billion in 2020, owing largely to the economic contraction brought about by the quarantine restrictions. Specifically, the decline was driven by the following:
• Reduced traffic on toll roads; Core net income contribution of Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation (MPTC) to MPIC was Php2.4 billion;
• Mandated suspension and subsequent reduction in ridership capacity for light rail services; Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC) contributed a net loss of Php0.3 billion to MPIC;
• Decreased commercial and industrial demand for power and water; MPIC’s power business, which includes Manila Electric Company (Meralco) and Global Business Power Corporation (GBPC) contributed Php10.5 billion while Maynilad Water Services (Maynilad) and MetroPac Water (MPW) contributed Php3.1 billion; and,
• Lower share in the earnings of the hospital business after the sell-down of interest to KKR & Co. in 2019.
Reported net income attributable to equity holders declined by 80% from Php23.9 billion in 2019 to Php4.7 billion in 2020 due to impairment losses in Meralco’s investment in Pacific Light Power and MPIC’s investment in Landco Pacific, and interest accretion on provision for over-recoveries. Excluding non-recurring income or expenses, MPIC reported a core income of Php10.2 billion in 2020 from Php15.6 billion in 2019.
