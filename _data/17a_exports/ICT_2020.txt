On January 3, 2019, ICTSI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ICTSI Middle East DMCC, signed a Concession Agreement (‘the Agreement’) with Sea Ports Corporation (SPC) of Sudan to operate, manage, and develop the South Port Container Terminal (SPCT) at the Port of Sudan, Republic of the Sudan for 20 years. The Port of Sudan is the only major modern port in the Republic of the Sudan and serves as the international gateway for more than 95% of country’s cargo flows.

Pursuant to the Agreement, ICTSI is required to pay: (a) an upfront fee of EUR530.0 million in installments of EUR410.0 million (US$467.2 million) and five other installments each in the amount of EUR24.0 million (US$27.3 million) from the third to the seventh operation year; (b) fixed monthly fee; and (c) royalty fee during the concession period. The Agreement is secured by a sovereign guarantee by the Republic of the Sudan. On January 13, 2019, ICTSI paid the initial installment of upfront fee of EUR410 million (US$470.2 million). In February 2019, ICTSI established Africa Gateway Terminal (AGT), a Sudanese entity, to operate the container terminal.


On January 8, 2019, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning of the Republic of the Sudan (the “Ministry”) issued a bond (the “Refund Bond”), which was subsequently amended, wherein it agreed to refund the Upfront Fee in case ICTSI is unable to take over operations by April 7, 2019.
On August 7, 2019, due to the ongoing political instability in the Republic of the Sudan and the failure of the Sudanese government to turn over SPCT on or before April 7, 2019, the Ministry sent ICTSI a letter confirming: (1) the remittance of EUR195.2 million (US$219.1 million) as partial repayment of the Upfront Fee under the terms of the Refund Bond and (2) that the balance will be repaid as soon as possible. On December 13, 2019, ICTSI, through ICTSI Middle East DMCC, received from the Sudanese Government a second partial repayent of the Upfront Fee in the amount of AED110.2 million (US$29.8 million). ICTSI continues productive discussions with the Ministry on the remaining balance of the Upfront Fee under the terms of the Refund Bond which the Ministry has expressly committed its obligations in its letter of June 25, 2020 (which was recently reconfirmed in a letter dated February 16, 2021). ICTSI reserves and continues to reserve its rights under the Concession Agreement following a letter from SPC regarding its cancellation which ICTSI disputes, and to pursue remedies available under the Refund Bond. ICTSI has an excellent track record of managing and making significant investments in its container terminal infrastructure and is committed to making the Port of Sudan a leading port and strategic gateway to Africa, benefitting all of its stakeholders.

Consolidated interest income decreased by 15.3 percent to US$19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from US$22.8 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to lower interest income earned from advances to SPIA, a joint venture associate.
Foreign exchange gain decreased to US$4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from
US$13.1 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to the impact of the change in functional currency of CMSA from USD to MXN in 2019, and unfavorable translation impact of certain currencies against US dollar.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 2.1 percent to US$230.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from US$235.0 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to lower amortization expense on the concession rights assets at CGSA as a result of the extension of its concession period in December 2019 by an additional 19 years; and at Tecplata arising from the reduced carrying value of its concession right assets following the non-recurring impairment charge in December 2019, partially tapered by the contribution of new terminal, ICTSI Rio, and higher depreciation expense on property and equipment at ICTSI Parent.

Interest and financing charges on borrowings increased by 1.4 percent to US$109.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from US$108.2 million for the same period in 2019 primarily due to availment of senior notes at ICTSI Parent in June 2020 and capitalization of borrowing costs in December 2019, tapered by repayment of loans at VICT and ICTSI Global Finance B.V. (IGFBV).

Interest expense on lease liabilities decreased by 4.9 percent to US$97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from US$102.4 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to favorable translation impact of BRL-based interest expense at TSSA and MXN-based interest expense at CMSA; partially tapered by the unfavorable translation impact of AUD-based interest expense at VICT.

Interest on concession rights payable increased by 30.4 percent to US$52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from US$40.5 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to the liability for concession rights recognized at new terminals, ICTSI Rio and KMT; and higher interest expense on CGSA as a result of the extension of its concession period in December 2019 by an additional 19 years.

Equity in net loss of joint ventures and an associate decreased by 37.9 percent to US$12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from US$19.7 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to the Company’s share in lower net loss of SPIA and the higher net income at MNHPI.

Consolidated EBITDA increased by 5.6 percent to US$876.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from US$830.1 million for the same period in 2019 primarily due to higher revenues and lower cash operating expenses resulting from continuing group-wide cost reduction and optimization measures and positive contribution of a new terminal, ICTSI Rio. Excluding the contribution of new businesses, consolidated EBITDA would have increased by 3.3 percent in 2020. EBITDA margin increased to 58.2 percent in 2020 from 56.0 percent in 2019.
Meanwhile, consolidated EBIT increased by 8.7 percent to US$646.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from US$595.2 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to stronger EBITDA and lower depreciation and amortization charges.

The ratio of income before income tax to consolidated gross revenues stood at 13.1 percent and 12.9 percent in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Consolidated provision for current and deferred income taxes decreased by 9.3 percent to
US$55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from US$60.8 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to recognition of tax benefit on loss carry-over at ICTSI Rio and partly due to lower taxable income at certain terminals; tapered by lower income tax benefit on improved net operating results at VICT. Effective income tax rate in 2019 and 2020 stood at 31.4 percent and 28.3 percent, respectively.

Consolidated net income increased by 5.3 percent to US$139.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from US$132.7 million for the same period in 2019. Excluding contribution of new businesses and the non-recurring items, consolidated net income would have still increased by 5.3 percent in 2020.

The Group is exposed to a number of trends, events or uncertainties which can affect its recurring revenues and profits. These include levels of general economic activity and containerized trade volume in countries where it operates, as well as certain cost items, such as labor, fuel and power. In addition, the Group operates in a number of jurisdictions other than the Philippines and collects revenues in various currencies. Continued appreciation of the US dollar relative to other major currencies, particularly the Philippine peso, Brazilian Reais, Mexican peso, and the Australian Dollars, may have a negative impact on the Group’s reported levels of revenues and profits.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic.
In the Philippines, in a move to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the Office of the President of the Philippines issued a Memorandum directive on March 13, 2020 to impose stringent social distancing measures in the National Capital Region effective March 15, 2020. On March 16, 2020, Presidential Proclamation No. 929 was issued, declaring a State of Calamity throughout the Philippines for a period of six (6) months and imposed an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) throughout the island of Luzon until April 12, 2020, which was extended to April 30, 2020. Through several extensions continuing as of March 2, 2021, Metro Manila and certain areas of the country were placed under different categories of community quarantine depending on the risk classification of the area.
Likewise, government authorities in other countries where the Group operates, adopted measures, including lockdowns, to control the spread of the virus and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.

These measures have caused disruptions to businesses, global supply chain, and economic activities, and its impact continues to evolve.
The scale and duration of these developments remain uncertain as of the report date. The Group observed declines in general business, including container throughput and revenues. It is not possible to estimate the overall impact of the outbreak’s near-term and longer effects, however, the Group has already incurred and will continue to incur costs as the Group continues to mitigate the adverse impact of the outbreak on its operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic does not have significant impact to the collectability of the Group’s trade receivables in 2020. The customers’ payment terms were not extended due to the pandemic. The overdue trade receivables however increased in the first two months of strict community lockdowns but have greatly improved in the succeeding months and the good momentum was sustained up to December 31, 2020. Considering the evolving nature of this pandemic, the Group will continue to monitor the situation. Uncertainties in market trends and economic conditions may persist due to COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact actual results and differ materially from the estimates of expected credit losses.

Total assets increased by 7.7 percent to US$6.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 from US$5.8 billion as at December 31, 2019 mainly due to cash generated from operations as well as proceeds from debt and equity financing activities; recognition of concession rights on fixed fees of new terminal, KMT; capital expenditures arising from expansion projects at MICT, CMSA, ICTSI Iraq and CGSA; and yard expansion at IDRC. These investments were funded mainly by cash generated from the Group’s operations and debt financing. The increase in total asset is, however, tapered by the nonrecurring impairment charge on the concession rights at Tecplata and other nonfinancial assets. Noncurrent assets stood at 91.9 percent and 84.4 percent of the total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
Current assets increased by 106.9 percent to US$969.2 million as of December 31, 2020 from
US$468.4 million as of December 31, 2019 mainly attributable to cash and cash equivalents due to cash generated from operations; and mainly due to net cash proceeds from issuances of new senior notes at ICTSI Parent and senior unsecured perpetual capital securities; partially tapered by settlement of senior notes at ICTSI Parent, pre-termination of loan at IGFBV, repayment of loan at VICT; and deployment of cash to fund capital expenditures. Current assets accounted for 8.1 percent and 15.6 percent of the total consolidated assets of the Group as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

ICTSI and its subsidiaries’ geographically diverse operations expose the Group to various market risks, particularly foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, which movements may materially impact the financial results of the Group. The importance of managing these risks has significantly increased in light of the heightened volatility in both the Philippine and international financial markets.
With a view to managing these risks, the Group has incorporated a financial risk management function in its organization, particularly in the treasury operations.

The Group has geographically diverse operations and transacts in currencies other than its functional currency. Consequently, the Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuation of the exchange rates between the US dollar and other local currencies such as PHP, AUD, BRL, MXN and EUR that may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position. The Group attempts to match its revenues and expenses whenever possible and, from time to time, engages in hedging activities to mitigate residual exposures. Changes in exchange rates affect the US dollar value of the Group’s revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group’s non-US dollar currency-linked revenues was 51.0 percent and 51.8 percent of gross revenues for the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Foreign currency-linked revenues include the following: (1) arrastre charges of MICT; and (2) non-US dollar revenues of international subsidiaries. ICTSI incurs expenses in foreign currency for the operating and start up requirements of its international subsidiaries. Concession fees payable to port authorities in certain countries are either denominated in or linked to the US dollar.

The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates (cash flow interest rate risk) relates primarily to the Group’s bank loans and is addressed by a periodic review of the Group’s debt mix with the objective of reducing interest cost and maximizing available loan terms. The Group also enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

The Group manages its liquidity profile to be able to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through internally generated cash and proceeds from debt and/or equity. As part of the liquidity risk management, the Group maintains strict control of its cash and makes sure that excess cash held by subsidiaries are up streamed timely to the Parent Company. The Group also monitors the receivables and payables turnover to ensure that these are at optimal levels. In addition, it regularly evaluates its projected and actual cash flow information and continually assesses the conditions in the financial market to pursue fund raising initiatives. These initiatives may include accessing bank loans, project finance facilities and the debt capital markets.
ICTSI monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank credit facilities deemed adequate to finance the Group’s operations, ensure continuity of funding and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.
There are no other known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will materially affect the company’s liquidity.
