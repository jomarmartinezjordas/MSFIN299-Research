discussions on the remaining balance of the Upfront Fee under the terms of the Refund Bond, which the Ministry continues to expressly commit its obligations. ICTSI reserves and continues to reserve its rights under the Concession Agreement following a letter from SPC regarding its cancellation which ICTSI disputes, and to pursue remedies available under the Refund Bond. ICTSI has an excellent track record of managing and making significant investments in its container terminal infrastructure and is committed to making the Port of Sudan a leading port and strategic gateway to Africa, benefitting all of its stakeholders.

The Group is exposed to a number of trends, events, and uncertainties which can affect its recurring revenues and profits. These include levels of general economic activity and containerized trade volume in countries where it operates, as well as certain cost items, such as labor, fuel, and power. In addition, the Group operates in a number of jurisdictions other than the Philippines and collects revenues in various currencies. Appreciation of the US Dollar relative to other major currencies, particularly the Philippine peso, Brazilian reais, Mexican peso, Australian dollars and the Euro, may have a negative impact on the Group’s reported levels of revenues and profits.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic.
In the Philippines, in a move to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 13, 2020, the Office of the President of the Philippines issued a Memorandum directive to impose stringent social distancing measures in the National Capital Region effective March 15, 2020. On March 16, 2020, Presidential Proclamation No. 929 was issued, declaring a State of Calamity throughout the Philippines for a period of six (6) months and imposed an enhanced community quarantine throughout the island of Luzon until May 15, 2020. Thereafter, several extensions of community quarantines at different levels were implemented in Metro Manila and different areas in the Philippines. As at March 1, 2022, community quarantine restrictions of varying levels are still in effect in Metro Manila and other parts of the country in order to manage the spread of the virus.
Likewise, government authorities in other countries where the Group operates, adopted measures, including lockdowns, to control the spread of the virus and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
These measures have caused disruptions to businesses, global supply chain, and economic activities, and its impact continues to evolve. The Group observed declines in general business, including container throughput and revenues, and has already incurred and will continue to incur costs as the Group mitigates the adverse impact of the outbreak on its operations.

On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a military attack on Ukraine that escalated an ongoing conflict that began in 2014.This event sets several uncertainties with the potential to disrupt businesses and institutions and poses threat to world trade and economies, in general. The continuing effect of the situation on business and institutions could result in business continuity interference, trade disruptions, rising prices of basic commodities including oil and power, among others. The Group has no exposure to investments in Ukraine or Russia.
The scale and duration of these developments and event remain uncertain as of March 1, 2022. It is not possible to estimate the overall impact of the outbreak and war’s near-term and longer effects, and could have a material impact on the Group’s financial results for the rest of 2022 and even periods thereafter. Considering the evolving nature of the pandemic and the war, the Group will continue to closely monitor these situations.

ICTSI and its subsidiaries’ geographically diverse operations expose the Group to various market risks, particularly foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, which movements may materially impact the financial results of the Group. The importance of managing these risks has significantly increased in light of the heightened volatility in both the Philippine and international financial markets.
With a view to managing these risks, the Group has incorporated a financial risk management function in its organization, particularly in the treasury operations.

The Group has geographically diverse operations and transacts in currencies other than its functional currency. Consequently, the Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuation of the exchange rates between the US dollar and other local currencies such as PHP, AUD, BRL, MXN and EUR that may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position. The Group attempts to match its revenues and expenses whenever possible and, from time to time, engages in hedging activities. Changes in exchange rates affect the US dollar value of the Group’s revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies. The Group also enters into cross currency swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the net investments in its subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group’s non-US dollar currency-linked revenues was 51.8 percent and 55.3 percent of gross revenues for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Foreign currency-linked revenues include the following: (1) arrastre charges of MICT; and (2) non-US dollar revenues of international subsidiaries. ICTSI incurs expenses in foreign currency for the operating and start up requirements of its international subsidiaries. Concession fees payable to port authorities in certain countries are either denominated in or linked to the US dollar.

The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates (cash flow interest rate risk) relates primarily to the Group’s bank loans and is addressed by a periodic review of the Group’s debt mix with the objective of reducing interest cost and maximizing available loan terms. The Group also enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

The Group manages its liquidity profile to be able to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through internally generated cash and proceeds from debt and/or equity. As part of the liquidity risk management, the Group maintains strict control of its cash and makes sure that excess cash held by subsidiaries are up streamed timely to the Parent Company. The Group also monitors the receivables and payables turnover to ensure that these are at optimal levels. In addition, it regularly evaluates its projected and actual cash flow information and continually assesses the conditions in the financial market to pursue fund raising initiatives. These initiatives may include accessing bank loans, project finance facilities and the debt capital markets.
ICTSI monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank credit facilities deemed adequate to finance the Group’s operations, ensure continuity of funding and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.
There are no other known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will materially affect the company’s liquidity.
