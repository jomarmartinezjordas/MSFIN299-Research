The 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements of JFC was restated to reflect the additional gain of P1,104.5 million (P883.6 million of which was attributable to the Parent Company) resulting from the finalization of the independent 3rd Party Valuation of Intangibles in 2020, relative to the acquisition of The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf®.

Consolidated revenues decreased by P50,313.2 million or 28.0% to P129,313.0 million for the year 2020, primarily as a result of permanent closure of stores and lower sales per store due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The negative impact of foreign currency translation was less than 1%.

SWS is the Group’s measure for all sales to consumers, both from Group-owned and franchised stores. Consolidated SWS decreased by P67,821.9 million or 27.8 per cent, from P243,792.2 million for 2019 to P175,970.3 million for 2020.

As at March 31, 2020, the Group had 5,974 JFC Group-owned and franchised stores globally, of which 50% were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions were gradually lifted in April, May, June, and July 2020, JFC reopened more stores and the percentage of stores that were temporarily closed was reduced to 40%, 26%, 12% and 10% as of April 30 and May 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and July 31, 2020, respectively. On August 4 to 18, 2020, some parts of the Philippines went back to Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine resulting in higher temporary closure of domestic stores from 8% as of July 31, 2020 to 10% as of August 31, 2020. In September, October, November and December 2020, JFC reopened more stores and the percentage of stores that were temporarily closed was reduced to 7%, 6%, 5% and 4%, respectively.

As the JFC Group’s stores are resuming operations all over the world, the speed of recovery in same store sales varied across different countries and territories. In general, same store sales recovered faster in developed countries than in developing countries. For example, some of the brands’ stores in North America recorded positive same store sales growth since mid-April 2020, primarily due to the high purchasing power which was fueled by the stimulus package and unemployment pay. In China, JFC’s businesses have started to recover with most brands registering positive same store sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. In EMEAA, Jollibee in Singapore, Brunei and Oman registered positive same store sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the Philippines, recovery has been slow because of higher level of restrictions and lack of public transportation.

The JFC Group opened 338 stores worldwide (Philippines 81; Foreign 257) and closed 486 stores (Philippines 181; Foreign business 305) in 2020. It ended the year 2020 with 5,824 stores, 2.5% lower compared to the number of stores at the end of December 2019.

Consolidated direct costs for the year 2020 decreased to P115,726.3 million, which is P34,531.5 million or 23.0% lower than the consolidated direct costs for the year 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease in: (i) the cost of inventories and (ii) store and manufacturing costs.

Consolidated cost of inventories decreased relative to the decrease in revenues. As a percentage of revenues, cost of inventories decreased by 1.9%-points year-on-year (YoY).
Consolidated store and manufacturing costs decreased by 12.5% to P56,727.0 million resulting from: (a) closure of non-performing stores; (b) headcount reduction in stores that remain open; (c) closure of some commissaries in the Philippines; (d) downsizing of commissary operations which started in April, including headcount reduction. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated store and manufacturing costs increased by 6.3%-points primarily due to the significant decline in revenues.
The following discussion details the components of store and manufacturing costs, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019:
Personnel costs decreased primarily as a result of: (a) permanent closure of 311 company- owned stores; (b) permanent closure of 4 commissaries in the Philippines; (c) headcount reductions in existing stores and commissaries and main offices in the Philippines and abroad.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily as a result of the full year impact of the consolidation of CBTL compared to only three months depreciation expense for the year 2019.
Contracted services expenses decreased primarily as a result of the factors discussed above (see discussion on Consolidated store and manufacturing costs).
Electricity expenses decreased primarily as a result of: (a) closure of non-performing stores; and, (b) closure of some commissaries in the Philippines.

Consolidated expenses increased by P3,508.8 million or 15.3%. from P22,889.3 million for the year 2019 to P26,398.1 million for the year 2020, primarily as a result of: (a) expenses related to the JFC Group’s business transformation program; and (b) the full year impact of the consolidation of CBTL compared to only three months operating expenses for the year 2019. The increase in consolidated operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in other business units expenses as employees at support services and main offices in most countries work from home while some restaurant outlets are temporarily closed.
The following table summarizes the breakdown of the Jollibee Group’s general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the percentage of each component and the consolidated cost of sales to consolidated revenues:

1. There were no events during the period that will trigger direct or contingent financial obligation that is material to the JFC Group.
2. There were no material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations created during the reporting period.
3. In response to the disruption in the operations of the business brought by the COVID-19 epidemic, JFC postponed about P9,000.0 million worth of capital expenditures from 2020 to 2021 given the operational constraints to the construction of facilities and to the uncertain demand volume due to limited mobility of consumers. Capital expenditures for 2020 were reduced from the planned P14,000.0 million to P5,922.0 million.
4. Food service operations have both peak and lean seasons. Historically, sales in the second and fourth quarters are strong due to the summer and the Christmas seasons, respectively. Demand during the first and third quarters usually slackens. The material financial impact of this seasonality has been considered in the Jollibee Group’s consolidated financial forecast.
5. All of the JFC Group’s income arose from its continuing operations.
6. Events after the Reporting Period:
On April 8, 2021, the BOD of the Parent Company approved a cash dividend of =P0.78 pershare of common stock to all stockholders of record as at April 26, 2021. Consequently, the cash dividend is expected to be paid out on May 12, 2021. The cash dividend is 25.8% higher than the P=0.62 cash dividend per share declared on April 7, 2020.
President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law on March 26, 2021 the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act to attract more investments and maintain fiscal prudence and stability in the Philippines. Republic Act (RA) 11534 or the CREATE Actintroducesreformstothecorporateincometaxandincentivessystems. Ittakeseffect 15 days after its complete publication in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation or April 11, 2021.The following are the key changes to the Philippine tax law pursuant to the CREATE Act which have an impact to the JFC Group:
Effective July 1, 2020, regular corporate income tax (RCIT) rate is reduced from 30% to 25% for domestic and resident foreign corporations. For domestic corporations with net taxable income not exceeding P=5 million and with total assets not exceeding =P100 million (excluding land on which the business entity’s office, plant and equipment are situated) during the taxable year, the RCIT rate is reduced to 20%.
Minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) rate reduced from 2% to 1% of gross income effective July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2023.
Imposition of improperly accumulated earnings tax (IAET) is repealed.
For investments prior to effectivity of CREATE:
Registered business enterprises granted only an income tax holiday (ITH) – can continue with the availment of the ITH for the remaining period of the ITH.
As clarified by the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards Council in its Philippine Interpretations Committee Q&A No. 2020-07, the CREATE Act was not considered substantively enacted as at December 31, 2020 even though some of the provisions have retroactive effect to July 1, 2020.
The passage of the CREATE Act into law on March 26, 2021 is considered as a non- adjusting subsequent event. Accordingly, current and deferred income taxes as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 continued to be computed and measured using the applicable income tax rates as at December 31, 2020 (i.e., 30% RCIT / 2% MCIT) for financial reporting purposes.
