SWS is the JFC Group’s measure for all sales to consumers, both from Group-owned and franchised stores. Consolidated SWS increased by P35,749.2 million or 20.3% to P211,719.5 million for the year 2021 compared to P175,970.3 million for the year 2020.
Consolidated revenues increased by P24,262.6 million or 18.8% to P153,575.6 million for the year 2021 compared to consolidated revenues for the year 2020.
The increase in consolidated revenues and system wide sales was primarily due to the low base of 2020 as a result of the impacts of the pandemic as well as improvement in sales performance of some businesses from new stores and strong same store sales growth.
As at December 31, 2021, the JFC Group had 5,924 company-owned and franchised stores globally, of which 3% were temporarily closed due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Same store sales of the Philippine business increased by 13.4% in 2021 compared to 2020. The international business also grew by 13.4%, with North America increasing by 19.7%, China by 15.7%, Europe/Middle East and other parts of Asia (EMEAA) by 6.4%, and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf® (CBTL) by 13.9%. SuperFoods declined by 15.1% primarily due to COVID- 19 related restrictions imposed on some parts of Vietnam.

The JFC Group opened 398 stores worldwide (Philippines 85; Foreign 313) and closed 302 stores (Philippines 86; Foreign business 216) in 2021. It ended the year 2021 with 5,924 stores, 1.7% lower compared to the number of stores at the end of December 2020.

Consolidated direct costs for the year 2021 increased to P127,496.7 million, which is P11,770.3 million or 10.2% higher than the consolidated direct costs for the year 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in: (i) the cost of inventories and (ii) store and manufacturing costs.

Consolidated cost of inventories increased relative to the increase in revenues. As a percentage of revenues, cost of inventories decreased by 0.9% year-on-year (YoY) primarily due to the increase in the contribution of international and coffee businesses which have higher gross profit margins on products than those in the Philippines. Selling price adjustments made in different parts of the world during the year also contributed to the improvement.
Consolidated store and manufacturing costs increased by 3.7% to P58,802.1 million resulting from an increase in the JFC Group’s owned stores network. The JFC Group opened 246 owned stores and closed 145 owned stores globally in 2021. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated store and manufacturing costs decreased by 5.7% primarily due to savings generated from the Business Transformation program implemented in 2020 which included (a) closure of non-performing stores; and, (b) closure of four commissaries in the Philippines.
The following discussion details the components of store and manufacturing costs, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020:
For the year 2021, Depreciation, Electricity, Repairs and maintenance, Security and janitorial and Communication expenses, Representation and entertainment expenses decreased as a result of the business transformation program implemented in 2020, which covered: (a) permanent closure of company-owned stores; (b) permanent closure of 4 commissaries in the Philippines; and (c) headcount reduction in existing stores and commissaries in the Philippines and abroad.
Professional fees decreased, primarily as a result of postponement or cancellation of some projects due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Delivery costs, insurance and others increased, primarily due higher delivery costs as a result of increased sales contribution of the delivery channel.
Cost of services – advertising increased, primarily as a result of more ad spending on media placements to drive sales.
As a result of the foregoing, gross profit increased by P12,492.2 million or 91.9% from P13,586.7
million for the year 2020 to P26,078.9 million for the year 2021.
Consolidated expenses decreased by P6,593.8 million or 25.0%. from P26,398.1 million for the year 2020 to P19,804.3 million for the year 2021, primarily as a result of cost reduction from the Business Transformation program as well as a decrease in other business units’ expenses as many employees at support services and main offices in most countries continued to work from home.

Personnel costs decreased, primarily as a result of: (1) headcount reduction in relation to the business transformation program; and (2) higher personnel costs in 2020, substantially due to separation packages given to employees affected by the business transformation program.
Taxes and licenses expenses increased due to higher business-related taxes and license fees, both domestic and foreign businesses.
Professional fees decreased on account of higher expenses in 2020 driven by: (a) consulting fees paid by CBTL in relation to organizational restructuring, (b) expenses relating to the issuance of senior perpetual securities in January 2020 and senior debt securities in June 2020.
The JFC Group recognized a reversal of P739.4 million on previously recognized provisions for impairment on property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, receivables, and inventories in 2021 following certain assessments performed by the Group. In addition, the Group recognized provisions for impairment of value of property, plant and equipment, receivables and inventories amounting to P287.0 million, following certain assessments performed by the Group.

Depreciation and amortization decreased due to reduction in office space in the corporate headquarters.
Rent expenses decreased, primarily due to a reduction in rental space in the corporate headquarters.
Membership and subscription expenses increased, primarily due to an increase in cloud subscriptions.
Repairs and maintenance expenses increased due to software maintenance system in North America.
Transportation and travel expenses decreased, primarily due to limited mobility and implementation of work from home arrangement.
Communication expenses decreased, primarily as a result of a decrease in headcount and the implementation of work from home arrangement for office-based employees, particularly in the Philippines.
Insurance increased driven by the expansion of the foreign business.
Training expenses decreased, primarily as a result of postponement of some training programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Donations decreased primarily as a result of a higher base as the JFC Group distributed food aid to health workers and health care institutions and lower income sectors of the society at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Representation and entertainment expenses increased on account of a lower base arising from limited mobility in 2020 due to heightened restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Association dues increased as expenses related to 2020 were booked only this year due to delay in billings.

The JFC Group incurred loss on retirements and disposals of property, plant and equipment amounting to P54.6 as a result of change in store ownership, store closures and fixed asset disposals.
Electricity decreased primarily as a result of the implementation of work from home arrangements for all office-based employees in the Philippines and in some countries where the JFC Group operates for the safety of its employees.
Corporate events decreased, primarily as a result of reduced activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Research and development and others decreased due to lower other miscellaneous expenses.
Advertising and promotions increased driven by higher advertising expenses of the foreign business to further boost sales and support new product launches.
As a result of the foregoing, operating income increased by P19,086.1 million or 149.0% from an operating loss of P12,811.5 million for the year 2020 to an operating profit of P6,274.6 million for year 2021.

Interest income decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in short-term investments and lower interest rates.
Interest expense increased primarily as a result of (a) increased bank loans, (b) increased impact of PFRS 16—Leases, which amounted to P1,939.4 million in 2020 and P1,964.6 million in 2021.

Equity in net losses of joint ventures and an associate for 2021 pertains primarily to the equity in net losses of Tortas Frontera and C-Joy Poultry Meats Production, Inc., partly offset by the equity in net earnings of Golden Bee (Jollibee UAE), Entrek (Jollibee Brunei) and Titan Dining L.P. See Note 11 to the accompanying Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for details.

The decrease in consolidated other income - net was primarily due to higher base arising from the unrealized gain from financial assets at FVTPL for 2020.

The tax benefit in 2021 is significantly lower because of lower deferred tax assets (DTA) on Net Operating Loss Carry Over (NOLCO) due to recovery of some businesses in the Philippines partly offset by DTA write-off due to impact of the CREATE Act.
As a result of the foregoing, the JFC Group generated an income of P5,502.0 million for 2021 compared to a net loss of P12,633.6 million for the year 2020, an improvement of P18,135.6 million or +143.6%.

The decline was primarily due to redemptions made during the year.
- Consolidated inventories increased by P1,059.5 million or 12.8% to P9,355.3 million, primarily as a result of inventory build up in preparation for higher sales volume due to easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19, increase in prices of some raw materials and impact of the peso depreciation.

- The decrease in remeasurement loss on net defined benefit plan – net of tax by P260.3 million or 18.6% to P1,140.8 million was primarily as result of actuarial changes arising from changes in financial assumptions, basically due to higher discount rates.
- The decrease in consolidated other comprehensive loss on derivative liability of ₱128.7 million for the year 2021 or 91.0% to ₱12.8 million was primarily due to the recognition of unrealized gain in the interest rate swap resulting from higher fixed rate compared to current floating rate.

The JFC Group’s primary source of liquidity is from its cash flows from operations generated from revenues coming from store operations, franchising, and commissary sales to stores.
The cash reserves of the JFC Group in the form of financial assets at FVTPL was at ₱14,413.0 million as at December 31, 2021. This was partly used to service its USD-denominated debt and financing obligations, and fund the working capital and capital expenditures, especially for the Group’s North America and Europe store expansion as their respective economies continue to recover from the pandemic. The JFC Group’s continued strong earnings recovery resulted to a 3.8x higher EBITDA of ₱23,606.5 million for the year 2021 compared to the EBITDA of ₱4,837.1 million for the year 2020.
Overall, the JFC Group has financed operations and capital expenditures of its business units primarily through its cash generated from its operations and from its cash reserves (reflected in the balance sheet as financial assets at FVTPL. The capital expenditures spent for the year 2021 amounted to ₱7,875.0 million were primarily related to new stores and renovations.
Further, the Parent Company issued ₱12.0 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares in October 2021. The preferred shares issuance was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). In addition, the JFC Group, through JWPL, bought back about USD203 million of its USD600 million Perpetual Securities issued in January 2020, using a portion of the net proceeds of the preferred shares issuance. In line with this liability management plan, it has started reducing its short-term loans, a majority of which incurred during the onset of the pandemic in 2020, to further improve its leverage ratios. As at December 31, 2021, the JFC Group has repaid ₱7,695.5 million of its short-term loans, while ₱8,000 million was refinanced and converted into long- term loans.
Consolidated net cash provided by operating activities amounted to P19,848.9 million as at December 31, 2021, an increase of P20,354.2 million compared to the consolidated net cash used in operating activities of P505.3 million as at December 31, 2020. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in EBITDA and increase in trade payables and other current liabilities.
Consolidated net cash provided by investing activities amounted to P7,964.9 million as at December 31, 2021, an increase of P47,967.6 million or 120.0% compared to the net cash used in investing activities as at December 31, 2020 of P40,002.8 million. This was primarily a result of a redemption of P23,022.6 million in financial assets at FVPTL, partly offset by capital expenditures for the year 2021 of P7,863.8 and P7,970.7 million acquisitions of interests in joint ventures and associates.
Consolidated net cash used in financing activities amounted to P24,509.7 million as at December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of payments of short-term debt, lease liabilities, long-term debt, interest, coupons for senior perpetual securities and cash dividends, partly offset by the issuance of preferred shares and new loans.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 2021 stood at P24,692.7 million, P3,331.2 million or 15.6% higher than the December 31, 2020 balance of P21,361.5 million.

1. Any event that will trigger direct or contingent financial obligation that is material to the company, including any default or acceleration of an obligation.
There were no events during the period that will trigger direct or contingent financial obligation that is material to the JFC Group.
2. Any material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), and other relationships of the company with unconsolidated entities or other persons created during the reporting period:
There were no material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations created during the reporting period.
3. Any material commitments for capital expenditures, the general purpose such commitments, and the expected sources of funds for such expenditures.
The JFC Group spent ₱7,875.0 million for capital expenditures for 2021, 35.5% lower compared to the ₱12,200.0 million it provided for the year due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in some countries, particularly Vietnam, China, the United States.
For 2022, JFC has alloted ₱17,800.0 million in capital expenditures, significantly higher than the ₱7,875.0 million spending in 2021. ₱10,000.0 million was set for new stores and renovations of existing stores. JFC had planned for opening 500 new stores in 2022, after opening 398 in 2021. The balance of ₱7,800.0 million capital expenditures will be mostly for supply chain and business technology investments. JFC plans to build a new commissary facility in Cebu in order to support its expansion plans in Visayas and Mindanao. These capital expenditures will be primarily funded by cash generated from operations, bank loans and excess cash from the remaining proceeds from the bond issuances.
4. Any seasonal aspects that had a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations.
Food service operations have both peak and lean seasons. Historically, sales in the second and fourth quarters are strong due to the summer and the Christmas seasons, respectively. Demand during the first and third quarters usually slackens. The material financial impact of this seasonality has been considered in the JFC Group’s consolidated financial forecast.
5. Any know trends, events or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably expected to have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations should be described
The resurgence of the COVID-19 infections poses a risk for the group as with other businesses broadly if restrictions are reimposed thereby affecting business operations.
In 2020, the JFC Group implemented the Business Transformation Program which involved permanent closures of unprofitable stores worldwide, rationalization of supply chain (four commissaries were closed in the Philippines) and restructuring of general and administrative expenses. The Business Transformation Program translated to improved store profitability, reduction in operating and G&A expenses. As a result, the JFC Group delivered a remarkable recovery back to profits this 2021 from the losses incurred a year ago despite revenues in the Philippines still below pre-pandemic levels. The JFC Group’s brands have also adapted and continued to assess its store formats to enable off-premise capabilities due to the changing consumer behavior as well as regulatory safety requirements.
6. Any significant elements of income or loss that did not arise from the registrant’s continuing operations.
All of the JFC Group’s income arose from its continuing operations.
