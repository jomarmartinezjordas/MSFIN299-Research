JG Summit Holdings, Inc.’s consolidated net income from equity holders of the parent amounted to P=29.37 billion in 2017, a 169% increase from P=10.92 billion in 2016 due to the impairment losses recorded last year totaling P=16.71 billion primarily from the decline in market value of the Group’s investment in PLDT. The Group’s consolidated core net income after taxes (excluding non-operating and nonrecurring items) amounted to P=29.56 billion in 2017, relatively flat from P=29.97 billion in 2016, mainly due to the lower net income of our airline business which was affected by the rise in fuel prices, offset by the double-digit income growth in our petrochemicals business and increase in our equity earnings from associates particularly from United Industrial Corporation Limited (UICL), Manila Electric Company (Meralco) and Global Business Power Corporation (GBPC). Consolidated EBITDA reached P=70.67 billion in 2017 from P=69.37 billion in 2016.
Consolidated revenues grew 13.7% from P=240.50 billion in 2016 to P=273.45 billion in 2017 due to the performance of the following core subsidiaries:
∂ URC’s total revenues increased by 11.0% from P=112.61 billion in 2016 to P=125.01 billion in 2017 driven by the 30.1% increase in BCFG international sales and 33.6% sales growth of the sugar business.
∂ JG Petrochemicals Group revenues increased by 42.4% from P=29.07 billion in 2016 to P=41.41 billion in 2017 due to higher sales volume and average selling price of polymers and olefins.
∂ CEB’s total revenues went up by 9.9% from P=61.90 billion in 2016 to P=68.03 billion in 2017 mainly due to 3.2% growth in passenger volume and 3.8% increase in average fares.
∂ RLC’s total revenues slightly decreased from P=22.75 billion in 2016 to P=22.45 billion in 2017 due to lower real estate sales partially offset by the increase in rental revenues.
∂ The banking revenue increased 31.2% from P=3.41 billion in 2016 to P=4.48 billion this year due to increase in interest income recognized from finance receivables and trading gains.
Revenues from our core investments, however, declined this year as dividend income received by the Group dropped 28.5% from P=2.03 billion last year to P=1.45 billion this year mainly due to lower dividend income declared by PLDT from P=106 per share in 2016 to P=76 per share in 2017. Equity in net earnings of associates, primarily from our investments in UIC/Singapore Land and Meralco, increased by 21.2% from P=8.18 billion in 2016 to P=9.91 billion in 2017, including the P=719.18 billion full-year equity earnings take-up from GBPC in 2017.
Consolidated cost of sales and services in 2017 increased by 19.1% from P=144.09 billion last year to P=171.55 billion this year driven by the rise in fuel prices affecting our airline business, and higher input costs of our food and petrochemicals businesses.
The Group’s operating expenses increased by 13.6% from P=44.14 billion last year to P=50.16 billion this year due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses in the food and airline business units. As a result, Operating Income or EBIT amounted to P=51.73 billion in 2017 from P=52.27 billion in 2016.
Market valuation gain on financial assets at FVPL amounted to P=696.41 million in 2017 from a market valuation loss of P=57.68 million in 2016 primarily due to the P=628.50 million fair value gain recognized on the Group’s investment in convertible notes of Sea Limited. Market valuation loss on derivative financial instruments amounted to P=155.23 million in 2017, a significant swing of P=1.89 billion from a market valuation gain of P=1.73 billion in 2016. This is attributable mainly to the mark-to-market valuation losses on fuel hedging transactions of the airline business.
Market valuation loss on impaired available-for-sale investments recorded in 2016 pertains to the impairment loss recognized due to the significant drop in the market price of PLDT shares from an average acquisition cost of P=2,331 per share to P=1,365 per share as of end of 2016. As of end of 2017, PLDT’s share price was P=1,480, with the increase during the year recognized directly in equity under ‘Net unrealized gains on AFS investments’.
The Group recognized a net foreign exchange loss of P=902.72 million from P=2.64 billion reported last year due to the combined effects of appreciation of URC international subsidiaries’ local currencies against US dollar, particularly NZD, and lower depreciation of Philippine Peso against US Dollar this year compared to last year.
Other income (expense) - net account, which represents miscellaneous income and expenses, netted a gain of P=241.87 million from last year’s loss of P=487.96 million mainly due to the loss on sale of CEB’s aircraft last year.

Foods generated a consolidated sale of goods and services of P=125.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an 11.0% growth over last year. Sale of goods and services performance by business segment follows: (1) URC’s branded consumer foods (BCF) segment, excluding packaging division, increased 10.5%, to P=101.82 billion in 2017 from P=92.14 billion registered in 2016. BCF domestic operations’ net sales slightly decline from P=59.19 billion in 2016 to P=58.95 billion in 2017 which was mainly driven by the lower volume and unfavorable mix in the coffee category that dragged down the sustained growth performance in snacks and recovery of RTD beverages. BCF international sales increased by 30.1% to P=42.87 billion in 2017 against P=32.95 billion in 2016. In constant U.S. dollar (US$) term, sales improved by 21.2% to US$851 million in 2017 against last year due to full year consolidation of SBA as well as growth from Thailand and Malaysia, partly offset by Vietnam’s slower than expected recovery. Malaysia grew by 7.8% on the back of positive performances from snacks, wafer and chocolates while Thailand increased by 6.1% due to continuous growth with wafer and snack categories reaching their highest market shares to date. Vietnam’s steady recovery was driven by renewed campaign of C2 brand plus growing snackfoods business. Sale of goods and services in URC’s packaging division increased by 16.4% to P=1.28 billion in 2017 from P=1.10 billion recorded in 2016.

Sugar and renewables businesses grew by 33.6% and 15.5%, respectively, on the account of higher volumes. On the other hand, flour business declined by 3.8% due to lower volume and average selling price.

URC’s cost of sales consists primarily of raw and packaging materials costs, manufacturing costs and direct labor costs. Cost of sales increased by 12.2% to P=85.69 billion in 2017 from P=76.40 billion recorded in 2016 mainly coming from the effect of SBA full year consolidation.
URC’s gross profit for 2017 amounted to P=39.31 billion from P=36.21 billion reported in 2016. Gross profit margin decreased by 70 basis points from 32.2% in 2016 to 31.5% in 2017. Selling and distribution costs, and general and administrative expenses rose by 19.1% to P=24.36 billion in 2017 from P=20.45 billion registered in 2016. This increase resulted primarily from the following factors: (a) 23.5% increase in compensation and benefits to P=5.28 billion in 2017 from P=4.28 billion in 2016 due to SBA full year consolidation, increase in headcount and annual salary adjustments; (b) 10.3% increase in advertising and promotion costs to P=7.60 billion in 2017 from P=6.89 billion in 2016 due to promotion programs with key accounts and wholesalers, and new product launches; (c) 49.4% increase in contracted services to P=766 million in 2017 from P=513 million in 2016 due to additional conso warehouses and increase in shared services charges.

URC’s finance costs which consist mainly of interest expense increased by 54.0%, to P=1.43 billion in 2017 from P=927.12 million recorded in 2016 due to higher level of long-term debt, which was used to finance the acquisition of SBA.
URC’s finance revenue consists of interest income from investments in financial instruments, money market placements, savings and dollar deposits and dividend income from investment in equity securities. Finance revenue increased to P=225.58 million in 2017 from P=182.34 million in 2015 due to higher level of financial assets during the year.
Equity in net losses of joint ventures amounted to P=280.53 million in 2017 from P=166.72 million in 2016 due to equity share in the net losses of newly created joint venture, Vitasoy-URC.
Net foreign exchange gain decreased to P=154.19 million in 2017 from P=1.31 billion reported in 2016 due to the combined effects of appreciation of international subsidiaries’ local currencies against US dollar, particularly NZD, and depreciation of Philippine peso against US dollar.
Market valuation gain on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss amounted to P=71.02 million in 2017 from P=107.38 million in 2016 due to unfavorable fair value changes of derivative instruments, partially offset by the increase in market values of equity investments.
Impairment losses decreased to P=21.42 million in 2017 from P=185.59 million in 2016 due to last year’s higher inventory write-offs resulting from issues encountered in Vietnam.

The Division’s EBIT and EBITDA showed positive variances of 10.3% and 7.9%, respectively.
The Residential Division realized revenues is at P=6.57 billion this year, a decrease of 16.5% from last year, due to lower level of buyers meeting the equity requirement in recognizing sales based on percentage of construction completion.

The Hotels Division, a major contributor to the RLC’s recurring revenues, registered gross revenues of P=1.89 billion as against last year’s P=1.81 billion.

Air transportation generated gross revenues of P=68.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, 9.9% higher than the P=61.90 billion revenues earned last year mainly attributed to the increase in passenger revenues by 7.2% to P=49.93 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from P=46.59 billion registered in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the 3.2% growth in passenger volume to 19.7 million from last year’s 19.1 million resulted from the increase in CEB’s fleet from 57 aircraft as of December 31, 2016 to 61 aircraft as of December 31, 2017. The increase in average fares by 3.8% to P=2,529 in 2016 from P=2,436 in 2016 also contributed to the increase in revenues.

Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 16.6% to P=57.90 billion from P=49.65 billion last year primarily due to the rise in fuel prices in 2017 coupled with the weakening of the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar. The average published fuel MOPS price increased from U.S. $65.31 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 from U.S. $52.83 per barrel in 2016.

In 2017, CEB sold and delivered three Airbus A319 aircraft to a subsidiary of Allegiant Travel Company (Allegiant) and entered into lease amendment agreements which transferred economic ownership of six Airbus A320 aircraft to the counterparty which resulted to a gain of P=102.57 million.

A net foreign exchange gain of P=61.90 million was also recognized in 2017 from last year’s net foreign exchange loss of P=272.38 million. All these factors contributed to the net income of P=5.99 billion in 2017 from P=5.13 billion in 2016, or an improvement of 16.9%.
