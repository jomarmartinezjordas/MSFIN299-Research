The Group’s consolidated net income from equity holders of the parent likewise declined 34.7% from P=29.37 billion in 2017 to P=19.19 billion in 2018 resulted from weaker Philippine Peso against the US dollar, higher financing costs and market valuation losses on our financial assets.

Consolidated revenues grew 6.8% from P=273.45 billion in 2017 to P=291.92 billion in 2018 due to the performance of the following core subsidiaries:
URC’s total revenues increased by 2.2% from P125.01 billion in 2017 to P127.77 billion in 2018 driven by the 27.6% growth in feeds business and 14.8% total increase in sugar and renewables businesses.

Revenues from our core investments declined by 15.4% as the dividend income received by the Group decreased from P=1.45 billion last year to P=1.23 billion this year due to the lower dividends declared by PLDT (P=76 per share in 2017 to P=64 per share in 2018). Equity in net earnings of associates, primarily from our investments in UIC/Singapore Land, Meralco and GBPC, increased by 2.8% from P=9.91 billion in 2017 to P=10.18 billion in 2018, mainly due to the Group’s additional 2.4% stake in Meralco acquired in June 2017, partially offset by the decline in equity earnings from UIC.
