Consolidated EBITDA reached P=83.9 billion, a 27.5% increase from last year’s P=65.8 billion, due to the impact of PFRS 16 on depreciation expense. Excluding PFRS 16 adjustments, EBITDA would have only increased by 17%.
Consolidated revenues grew 3.4% from P=291.9 billion in 2018 to P=301.8 billion in 2019 due to the performance of the following core subsidiaries:
 URC’s total revenues increased by 5% from P=127.8 billion in 2018 to P=134.2 billion in 2019 driven by the 7.9% growth in branded consumer foods (BCF) domestic sales, 34.6% increase in feeds business, and 25.5% increase in flour sales.
 CEB’s total revenues went up by 14.4% from P=74.1 billion in 2018 to P=84.8 billion in 2019 mainly due to the 10.8% growth in passenger volume and 2.6% increase in average fares. The 21.0% increase in ancillary revenues also contributed to the increase.
 RLC’s total revenues increased by 2.5% from P=29.5 billion in 2018 to P=30.2 billion in 2019 due to growth in rental income and increase in hotel revenues.
 JG Petrochemicals Group revenues declined by 31.4% from P=42.4 billion in 2018 to P=29.1 billion in 2019 as a result of lower average selling prices and volumes.

The significant increase came from the SG$210.3 million one-off gain recognized by UIC on its acquisition of Marina Mandarin in the second quarter of 2019 which resulted to an additional P=3.0 billion equity income take-up by the Group in UIC. Dividend income for the year also increased by 9.9% as the dividends received by the Group from PLDT increased 12.5% (P=64 per share in 2018 to P=72 per share in 2019).

Market valuation gains on financial assets amounted to P=640.5 million in 2019 from a P=1.0 billion market valuation losses in 2018 attributable to the increase in fair values and realized gains on investment securities as well as the lower mark-to-market valuation losses on fuel hedging transactions of the airline business.
The Group recognized a net foreign exchange gain of P=828.7 million in 2019 from a net foreign exchange loss of P=2.9 billion in 2018 due to appreciation of Philippine Peso against US Dollar in 2019 (P=52.6 as of December 31, 2018 to P=50.6 as of December 31, 2019) as compared to the Philippine Peso depreciation in 2018 (P=49.9 as of December 31, 2017 to P=52.6 as of December 31, 2018).
