JG Summit’s portfolio diversity cushions COVID’s impact on FY20 core net income. JG Summit Holdings, Inc., one of the largest and highly-diversified conglomerates in the Philippines, ended 2020 with core net income after taxes of 450 million given the resiliency of its portfolio and the group’s agile response to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.The double-digit revenue growth in its banking and office segments, robust sales in food, and higher dividends from its telecommunications investment, tempered the negative impact of the pandemic to the Group’s overall operating results. Its petrochemical unit saw lower sales volumes and selling prices on the back of weaker global industrial demand while its air transport business was severely impacted by flight restrictions particularly in the onset of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). Equity earnings from its core investments in Meralco (MER), Global Business Power Corporation (GBPC) and United Industrial Corporation (UIC) also declined year-on-year (YoY). Thus, JG Summit’s consolidated revenues for the full year ending December 31, 2020 (FY20) amounted to 221.6 billion, 27% lower vs the same period last year (SPLY).The strong margin expansion in its food and banking units also provided some buffer to offset profit declines in other businesses. Incorporating nonrecurring fuel hedging losses and a one-off impairment charge from MER led JG Summit to report a consolidated net loss of 468 million. (Excluding Cebu Air, Inc., which operates in one the most affected industries globally, JG Summit’s revenues, core net income after tax and net income would have only declined 8%, 21%,and 42%, to 199.0 billion, 15.3 billion and 14.6 billion, respectively in FY20.)Consolidated cost of sales and services in 2020 decreased by 20.5% from 189.8 billion last year to 150.9 billion this year consistent with the decline in revenue of core businesses. The Group’s operating expenses increased by 5.1% resulting to a consolidated Operating Income or EBIT amounting to 12.1 billion in 2020 from 56.2 billion in 2019. EBITDA amounted to 43.7 billion versus 83.9 billion SPLY.The Group’s financing costs and other charges, net of interest income, decreased by 4.6% 8.5 billion this year from last year’s 8.9 billion primarily due to increase in capitalized borrowing costs of Petrochem, and to lower interest rates and level of the Group’s short-term debts.Market valuation losses on financial assets and derivative instruments amounted to 2.3 billion in 2020 from a market valuation gain of 640 million in 2019 attributable to the decline in market values of the Group’s financial assets at FVTPL resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on capital markets, and the hedging loss incurred by Cebu Pacific due to the discontinuation of hedge accounting application on non-effective hedges in 2020.The Group recognized a net foreign exchange gain of 2.6 billion in 2020 from 829 million foreign exchange loss in 2019 driven by the appreciation of Philippine peso vs U.S. dollar in respect to our dollar-denominated long-term debt. Other income (expense) - net account, which represents miscellaneous income and expenses, amounted to a loss of 632 million in 2020 mainly due to CEB’s loss on sale of aircraft and Robinsons Bank’s loan modification losses this year.Foods generated a consolidated sale of goods and services of 133.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, a slight decline of 0.8% sales reduction over last year.

BCF international operations reported a 5.4% decrease in net sales from 43.6 billion in 2019to 41.2 billion in 2020, with significant impact from forex devaluations particularly inOceania. In constant US dollar (US$) terms, sales is flat as growth in Oceania was able to offset the slower recovery of other Asean markets. Vietnam sales declined by 13.4% mainly driven by slowdown in beverages as C2 sales was unable to fully recover despite resurgence in 2nd half and Rong Do remained challenged due to school closures. Thailand sales decreased by 3.2% due to soft domestic consumption.

Gross profit margin increased by 79 basis points from 30.04% inP2019 to 30.84% in 2020.URC’s selling and distribution costs, and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation benefits, advertising and promotion costs, freight and other selling expenses, depreciation, repairs and maintenance expenses and other administrative expenses. Selling and distribution costs, and general and administrative expenses decreased by 290 million or 1.1% to 25.0 billion in 2020 from P25.3 billion registered in 2019. This decline resulted primarily fromdecreases in advertising and promotion costs, freight and other selling and travel and transportation, partially offset by increase in repairs and maintenance.As a result of the above factors, operating income increased by 1.0 billion or 6.9% to 16.0 billion in 2020 from P15.0 billion reported in 2019.URC’s finance costs consist mainly of interest expense, which decreased by 229.0 million to 1.4 billion in 2020 from P1.7 billion recorded in 2019 due to lower interest rates and level ofinterest-bearing financial liabilities. This offset the increase in interest expense related to additional lease contracts qualifying under PFRS 16 this year.URC’s finance revenue consists of interest income from investments in financial instruments,money market placements, savings and dollar deposits and dividend income from investment inequity securities. Finance revenue increased by 15.0 million to 342.0 million in 2020 from 328.0 million in 2019 due to higher dividend income.PEquity in net losses of joint ventures decreased to 30.0 million in 2020 from 159.0 million in2019 due to lower share in net losses from VURCI and DURBI.Net foreign exchange loss decreased to 486.0 million in 2020 from the 558.0 million reportedin 2019 due appreciation of Philippine peso against US dollar.Market valuation gain (loss) on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss increasedto 136.0 million gain in 2020 from 5.0 million loss in 2019 due to increase in market values ofequity investments and decrease in fair value of derivative liability.Impairment losses increased to 33.0 million in 2020 from 2.0 million in 2019 due to higherimpairment in receivables.Other income (expenses) - net consists of gain (loss) on sale of fixed assets, amortization of bondissue costs, rental income, and miscellaneous income and expenses.

This was mainly attributable to the 77.6%decline in passenger volume from 22.5 million to 5.0 million driven by lesser number of flights by70.9% coupled with a 10.5 ppts decrease in seat load factor from 86.4% to 75.9%.

As of December 31, 2020, CEB no longer has any equity interest in SIAEP. OnPthe same date, CEB acquired SIAEC’s 51% interest in A-plus, making the latter a whollysubsidiary of CEB. The recognition of the investment in A-plus as a subsidiary resulted to a gainon remeasurement of 71.3 million on CEB’s existing 49% shareholding. As a result of the foregoing, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to 22.2 billion, a decrease of 343.8% from the P9.12 billion net income earned in 2019.Petrochemicals (JGSPG - consist of JGSPC and JGSOC) ended 2020 with full year revenues of 21.3 billion, 27% lower vs SPLY. The global implementation of strict quarantines negativelyPaffected both local demand and exports, which in turn led to lower petrochemical prices YoY.Nonetheless, demand started to recover in the second half of the year as domestic customerscautiously restarted operations and as more countries reopened from lockdowns. Despite localmarket contraction in 2020, JGSPG managed to increase its polymer volume sales by 14% YoYand gained market share as JGSPG capitalized on resilient demand for flexible, basic film andagricultural packaging requirements. Meanwhile, lower naphtha prices lifted margins and ledJGSPG to report an EBITDA of 451 million in 2020. But higher depreciation resulted in a netloss of 2.0 billion.JGSPG is nearing the final stages of its US$1.1 billion expansion project with some of its keycomponents coming online in the second quarter of 2021. This would improve overallprofitability as the company captures more margins downstream.Banking services generated banking revenue of 9.2 billion in 2020, a 13% increase from lastyear’s 8.1 billion mainly driven by an 8% increase in loans, as well as the 939.0 million gainfrom trading activities. Despite booking 1.1 billion in provisions for bad loans, the strongtopline growth and the 76-basis point net interest margin improvement led to a net income of 935.0 million, a 30% growth. The bank’s non-performing loan ratio of 2.98% as of end-2020Premained lower than industry average amidst the risks posed by the pandemic. RBank alsoaccelerated its digitalization and customer-centric initiatives including RBank Digital (RDX), theBank’s mobile app, QuickR, a cashless payment solution using a QR code, and RBankMo,banking agents that will provide basic financial services among others. Moreover, there has beenexponential growth in its electronic funds’ transfers via InstaPay and PESONet, in line with theincreased adoption of e-payments and shift towards digital commerce caused by the pandemic.Equity in net earnings of associated companies and joint ventures amounted to 7.6 billionfor the year ended December 31, 2020, a 43% decrease from last year’s 13.4 billion. Thedecline was mainly driven by the absence of the 3.0 billion gain from UIC’s Marina Mandarintransaction in 2019 and JG Summit’s 1.3 billion share in MER’s impairment loss on its PacificLight Power investment in 2020. MER and GBPC also reported lower electricity revenues.Meanwhile, the dividends we received from our investment in PLDT, Inc. rose by 51%.Cash and cash equivalents increased to 81.5 billion as of December 31, 2020, from 64.3 billionas of December 31, 2019.
