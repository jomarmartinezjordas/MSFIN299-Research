JG Summit Holdings, Inc. (JGS), one of the leading Philippine conglomerates, remains on track to full recovery from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding its airline, Cebu Air, Inc. (CEB), which continued to deal with heightened travel restrictions, JGS saw its full-year 2021 (FY21) consolidated revenues exceed pre-pandemic levels by 7% while its core net income already reached 96% of its 2019 level.
Including CEB’s performance, JGS’ total revenues grew 13% year-on-year (YoY) to P=230.6 billion as the partial reopening of the economy benefited its food, real estate, petrochemicals, and banking segments. CEB likewise showed strong sequential improvements quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). JGS’ total consolidated core net income rose 672% YoY to P=3.5 billion, driven by the 46% YoY growth of RLC’s profits as well as larger contributions from its core investments in Meralco (MER), Singapore Land Group (SLG), and PLDT. However, there were also headwinds from elevated fuel prices, high inflation, and currency depreciation, which led to narrower operating margins for Universal Robina Corporation (URC), JG Summit Olefins Corporation (JGSOC), and CEB. Nonetheless, URC’s gain on the sale of its Oceania business and the benefits of CREATE law boosted the group’s total net income to P=5.1 billion.
Consolidated cost of sales and services in 2021 increased by 18.5% from P=140.0 billion last year to P=165.9 billion this year due to higher sales and increasing input costs particularly of URC, RLC and Petrochem. The Group’s operating expenses decreased by 2.0% resulting to a consolidated Operating Income or EBIT of P=11.4 billion in 2021, a 15.1% increase from P=9.9 billion in 2020. EBITDA from continuing operations amounted to P=41.0 billion versus P=40.3 billion last year.
The Group’s financing costs and other charges, net of interest income, increased by 4.1% to P=8.0 billion this year from last year’s P=7.7 billion primarily due to higher level of financial debt of CEB and Petrochem.
Market valuation losses on financial assets and derivative instruments amounted to P=1.1 billion in 2021, lower versus P=2.3 billion loss in 2020 attributable to the increase in market values of the Group’s financial assets and the lower valuation losses incurred by CEB - P=1.3 billion loss on its convertible bonds’ embedded derivatives in 2021 versus P=12.1 billion hedging loss in 2020.
The Group recognized a net foreign exchange loss of P=3.1 billion in 2021 from P=2.6 billion foreign exchange gain in 2020 driven by the depreciation of Philippine peso vs U.S. dollar in respect to our dollar-denominated long-term debt and convertible bonds payable.
Other income (expense) - net account, which represents miscellaneous income and expenses, amounted to a gain of P=568 million in 2021 mainly due to CEB’s gain on sale of aircraft.
Consolidated provision for income tax amounted to P=362 million in 2021 from P=2.7 billion in 2020 mainly due to Group’s savings from CREATE bill and higher deferred tax assets of CEB.

Flour business posted a 4.5% increased due to better selling price.
URC’s cost of sales consists primarily of raw and packaging materials costs, manufacturing costs and direct labor costs. Cost of sales increased by P=4.9 billion or 6.3% to P=83.5 billion in 2021 from P=78.6 billion recorded in 2020 due to higher sales and increasing input costs.
URC’s gross profit for 2021 amounted to P=33.5 billion, lower by P=1.1 million or 3.2% from P=34.6 billion reported in 2020. Gross profit margin decreased by 195 basis points from 30.57% in 2020 to 28.61% in 2021
URC’s selling and distribution costs and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation benefits, advertising and promotion costs, freight and other selling expenses, depreciation, repairs and maintenance expenses and other administrative expenses. Selling and distribution costs, and general and administrative expenses increased by P=57 million or 0.3% to P=20.75 billion in 2021 from P=20.69 billion registered in 2020. The increase primarily resulted from increases in repairs and maintenance, professional and legal fees and other administrative expenses partially offset by decreased advertising and promotion costs and taxes, licenses and fees.
▪ 23.9% or P=128 million increased in repairs and maintenance to P=664 million in 2021 from P=536 million in 2020 due to higher software and hardware maintenance costs.

BCFG’s domestic operations decline by 8.0% to P=7.6 billion in 2021 from P=8.3 billion in 2020 driven by increasing input costs partially offset by Php2.5B in cost headwinds partially offset by pricing, mix, and cost savings initiatives. International operations posted a P=1.7 billion operating income, 12.9% lower than the P=1.9 billion posted in 2020 driven by increasing input prices.

Renewable energy business increased by 24.9% due to better volume and average selling price of distillery segment.
URC’s finance costs consist mainly of interest expense, which decreased by P=88.4 million to P=573 million in 2021 from P=662 million recorded in 2020 due to lower interest rates and level of interest-bearing financial liabilities.
URC’s finance revenue consists of interest income from investments in financial instruments, money market placements, savings and dollar deposits and dividend income from investment in equity securities. Finance revenue decreased by P=68 million to P=255 million in 2021 from P=324 million in 2020 due to lower interest rates, level of interest-bearing financial assets and dividend income.
Equity in net losses of joint ventures increased to P=91 million in 2021 from P=62 million in 2020 due to equity take-up in net losses of DURBI.

Net foreign exchange loss decreased to P=504 million gains in 2021 from the P=346 million reported in 2020 driven by combined effects of local currency devaluations vis-à-vis US dollar this year versus local currency appreciation last year particularly Philippine Peso and Myanmar Kyat.
Market valuation gain on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss decreased to P=87 million in 2021 from P=136 million in 2020 driven by market valuation on derivative liability last year.

URC recognized consolidated provision for income tax of P=1.6 billion in 2021, a 20.0% decrease from P=2.0 billion in 2020 due to savings from CREATE bill and lower taxable income of URC international group.
URC’s net income from continuing operation amounted to P=13.0 billion, higher by P=2.5 billion or 23.4%, from P=10.5 billion for 2020 mainly driven by higher other income from gain on sale of fixed assets, turnaround impact of net foreign exchange losses and income tax savings.
URC’s net income from discontinued operations for 2021 amounted to P=11.3 billion, an increase of 906.8% from P=1.1 billion recorded in 2020 driven by gain from divestment of Oceania business this year.
URC’s consolidated net income for 2021 amounted to P=24.2 billion, higher by P=12.6 billion or 108.6% from P=11.6 billion in 2020 due to higher other income from gain on sale of fixed assets and businesses, turnaround impact of net foreign exchange losses and income tax savings.
Net income attributable to equity holders of the parent increased by P=12.6 billion or 117.0% to P=23.3 billion in 2021 from P=10.7 billion in 2020 as a result of the factors discussed above.
URC reported an EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization) of P=18.5 billion in 2021, 7.9% lower than P=20.1 billion posted in 2020.
Real estate and hotels generated total gross revenues of P=35.6 billion for calendar year 2021, an increase of 29.2% from P=27.5 billion the previous year with strong organic growth fueled by improved customer demand across RLC’s core businesses, the sale of parcels of land within the Bridgetowne East Destination Estate, and the continued success of the Chengdu Ban Bian Jie project in China. EBIT and EBITDA increased by 14.4% to P=9.7 billion and 9.4% to P=15.0 billion, respectively. This translated to a consolidated net income of P=8.5 billion, 61.6% greater versus the same period last year. Meanwhile, net income attributable to equity shareholders of the parent entity rose by 53.2% to P=8.1 billion.
The Commercial Centers Division accounted for 23% of total RLC’s revenues to close at P=8.3 billion in 2021, 2.7% lower versus previous year. The performance of the RLC’s lifestyle centers continued to rebound since the implementation of quarantine restrictions in March last year. The steep slump in mall revenues continued to shrink sequentially every quarter. Meanwhile, EBITDA and EBIT decreased by 6.1% to P=3.9 billion and 52.6% to P=0.2 billion, respectively, as cash operating expenses are flattish while depreciation and amortization dropped by 0.9%.
Encouraged by the resilient IT-BPM industry, Robinsons Offices finished the year strong and contributed 18% to total RLC revenues. Stable and high occupancy across existing assets, as well as rental escalations, carried revenues to a 9.2% increase to end at P=6.5 billion. EBITDA closed at P=5.7 billion, while EBIT ended at P=4.7 billion, up by 11.4% and 13.1%, respectively.
In 2021, RLC embarked on a rebranding strategy and launched “RLC Residences” – a single, integrated brand identity for its vertical projects.

Furthermore, RLC has recovered 89% of its invested capital with the repatriation of US$200 million in 2021.
With the gradual easing of travel restrictions and the re-opening of some tourist destinations, Robinsons Hotels and Resorts received demand for quarantine accommodations and long-stay bookings. Accounting for 3% of consolidated revenues, hotel revenues rose 11.0% to P=1.2 billion versus a year ago. EBITDA accelerated 60.3% to P=0.25 billion on the back of operational efficiencies; while depreciation from new hotels dragged EBIT to a loss of P=0.17 billion.

SRPI and RHK acquired a total of over 2.6 hectares of land inside the 31-hectare master-planned Bridgetowne Destination Estate.
Interest income was lower at P=0.17 billion from P=0.24 billion last year due to lower average balance of cash and cash equivalents during the calendar year 2021.
Cost of real estate sales went up by 116.6% to P=13.3 billion from P=6.2 billion last year due to increase as a function of increased realized sales. Cost of amusement services declined by 98.3% to P=0.02 billion as most of cinema operations remained suspended following IATF protocols.
Gain or loss from foreign exchange mainly pertains to foreign currency denominated transactions of the Company’s foreign subsidiary. Gain on sale of property and equipment mainly pertains to sale of retired transportation equipment. Gain from Insurance pertains to claims collected from insurance providers during the year.
Air transportation generated revenues amounting to P=15.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, 30.4% lower than the P=22.6 billion revenues earned in the same period last year mainly driven by the decrease in passenger revenue by P=6.3 billion or 50.2% to P=6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from P=12.6 billion generated in 2020. This was largely due to the 32.1% decline in passenger volume from 5.0 million to 3.4 million in line with lesser number of flights by 17.6% coupled with a 15.3 ppts decrease in seat load factor from 75.9% to 60.6%. Lower average fares by 26.7% to P=1,843 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from P=2,513 for the same period last year also contributed to lower revenues. Cargo operations continued to supplement the business as revenues grew by P=1.1 billion or 19.8% to P=6.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from P=5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 mostly due to increase in kilograms carried by about 10.4% and higher yield by 8.5%. Ancillary revenues decreased by P=1.6 billion or 35.0% to P=3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from P=4.6 billion recorded in the same period last year mainly attributable to lesser passenger volume and flight activity during the period.
CEB incurred operating expenses of P=38.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, lower by 10.3% compared to the P=43.4 billion operating expenses incurred for year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily brought about by the CEB’s reduced operations due to the COVID-19 global pandemic since a material portion of its expenses are based on flights and flight hours. The slight strengthening of the Philippine peso against the U.S. Dollar as referenced by the appreciation of the Philippine peso to an average of P49.27 per U.S. Dollar for the year ended December 31, 2021 from an average of P=49.61 per U.S. Dollar during the same period last year based on the Philippine Bloomberg Valuation (PH BVAL) weighted average rates also contributed to the drop in operating expenses.
As a result, CEB sustained an operating loss of P=23.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, 11.5% higher than the P=20.8 billion operating loss incurred for the same period last year.
Interest income decreased by P=121 million or 76.9% to P=36 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from P=158 million earned in the same period last year largely due to lesser cash balance particularly in the early months of 2021 and lower average interest rates on USD short term placements.
CEB recognized market valuation losses from its embedded derivative liability arising from its issuance of the convertible bonds amounting to P=1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, CEB incurred a hedging loss of P=2.2 billion due to the discontinuation of hedge accounting application on non-effective hedges last year.
CEB had equity in net loss of joint ventures and associates of P=174 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, P=142 million lower than the P=316 million equity in net loss of joint venture and associates incurred in the same period last year. A-plus and SIA Engineering (Philippines) Corporation (SIAEP) ceased to be joint ventures of the Group in November 2020, thus, reducing the Group’s equity in net loss in its joint ventures.
Interest expense increased by P=301 million or 17.5% to P=2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from P=1.7 billion for the same period last year due to the accrual of interest on convertible bonds issued last May 2021 and promissory notes availed in the latter part of 2020 and early 2021. This was offset by the sale and leaseback of five (5) A320 aircraft in the latter part of 2020 and the effect of the slight appreciation of the Philippine Peso against the U.S. Dollar.
On November 3, 2020, CEB signed a Deed of Absolute Sale of its 35% shareholding in SIA Engineering (Philippines) Corporation (SIAEP) to SIAEC which resulted to a gain on disposal of P=34.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, CEB no longer has any equity interest in SIAEP. On the same date, CEB acquired SIAEC’s 51% interest in A-plus, making the latter a wholly- subsidiary of CEB. The recognition of the investment in A-plus as a subsidiary resulted to a gain on remeasurement of P=71.3 million on CEB’s existing 49% shareholding. 

CEB assessed that its investment in Value Alliance Travel System Pte. Ltd (VATS) was impaired. VATS has incurred operating losses since it started its operations and is currently on a capital deficiency. Its target growth turned significantly lower than actual and expectation has also been further tempered due to the impact of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the foregoing, CEB recognized impairment loss amounting to P=37 million.
As a result of the foregoing, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to P=24.9 billion, higher than the P=22.2 billion net loss incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Petrochemicals (consist of JGSPC, JGSOC and Peak Fuel) combined gross revenues reached P=40.3 billion in 2021, almost double of last year’s P=21.3 billion, driven by strong volumes and higher average selling prices (ASP) due to strong demand recovery from the global economic slowdown in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the extended facility shutdown of JGSOC until 1Q 2020 for turnaround maintenance and project tie-ins. 2021 revenues also include the fresh contributions from its LPG trading business and the newly commissioned Aromatics Extraction Unit. EBITDA expanded 463% to P=3.1 billion on the back of strong volumes, which offset higher naphtha prices. Moreover, utilization rates improved considering the planned shutdowns in 1Q20. Full year cracker and polymer rates were at 91% and 83%, up from 70% and 69%, respectively.
Interest expense increased from P=369 million in 2020 to P=805 million in 2021 due higher level of trust receipts and short-term notes payable which were obtained to finance its working capital requirements and expansion projects. A net foreign exchange loss of P=404 million was also recognized in 2021 from last year’s net foreign exchange gain of P=396 million. All these factors contributed to the net loss of P=2.1 billion in 2021 from last year’s P=2.0 billion
Banking services generated banking revenue of P=9.3 billion in 2021 which remained stable from last year’s P=9.2 billion. This was driven by higher loans, which grew 14% YoY versus the industry’s 5%, and higher commission income, offset by lower trading gains. This loan expansion, coupled with stable net interest margins and a better cost-to-income ratio led to strong profit growth at 33% YoY, bringing net income to P=1.2 billion. Despite faster loan expansion, RBank's NPL ratio of 3.3% as of end-2021 remained lower than the industry average of 4.0%.
Equity in net earnings of associated companies and joint ventures amounted to P=9.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, a 27.7% increase from last year’s P=7.6 billion driven primarily by higher equity in net earnings of Meralco from P=4.6 billion in 2020 to P=6.7 billion in 2021 given the growth in energy consumption across Residential, Commercial, and Industrial segments. The absence of last year’s impairment charge on its Pacific Light Power investment also boosted income.
For Singapore Land Group, equity in net earnings increased to P=2.7 billion, from P=2.5 billion last year. The recognition of income from its residential joint venture tempered the negative impact of the pandemic on its property trading & technology operations segments.
Meanwhile, the dividends we received from our investment in PLDT, Inc. rose by 6% to P=2.0 billion from P=1.9 billion last year. PLDT raised its annual dividends to P=82 per share vs P=77 per share last year as hybrid work, home studying, and e-commerce, among others, led to improved earnings momentum.

Cash and cash equivalents increased to P=82.9 billion as of December 31, 2021, from P=81.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. Cash used in operating activities amounted to P=993 million. As of December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities amounted to P=17.0 billion mainly for the Group’s capital expenditure program and acquisition of Munchy’s, partially offset by the proceeds from sale of GBPC investment and Oceania business, and dividends received. The Group’s net cash provided by financing activities amounted to P=19.4 billion primarily due to proceeds from issuance of CEB’s convertible bonds and preferred shares, and RLC’s REIT offering. Our financial assets, including those held at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) (excluding derivative assets), fair value though other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and investment securities at amortized cost amounted to P=98.7 billion, a 26.0% increase from P=78.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 due to increase in market values and additional investments in private bonds and government securities.
Receivables, including noncurrent portion increased by 9.2% from P=135.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=147.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 mainly due to the increase in finance receivables of the banking business.
Inventories increased 7.7% from P=75.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=81.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 from higher raw materials of URC, and increases in Petrochem’s finished goods and raw materials, offset by inventory decline in RLC due to the sale of Chengdu Phase 1 project.
Biological assets, including noncurrent portion, increased by 27.3% due to increase in poultry population.
Other current assets decreased by 12.2% from P=27.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=23.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 mainly due to decline in input VAT of the petrochemicals business and decrease in cash under escrow of RLC.

Investment in associates and joint ventures increased by 4.8% from P=139.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=146.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 mainly due to equity in net earnings in Meralco and SLG during the year.
Investment properties increased 12.5% from P=104.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=117.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 due to land acquisitions, ongoing construction and development of real estate properties, net of depreciation during the year
Right-of-Use Assets increased 40.1% from P=23.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=32.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 due to delivery of six (6) plus the sale and leaseback of seven (7) aircrafts during the period, partially offset by the return of four (4) aircrafts to its lessors and depreciation during the period.
Goodwill and Intangibles declined to P=22.2 billion and P=4.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 due to divestment of Oceania businesses, partly offset by acquisition of Munchy’s.
Other noncurrent assets declined 6.2% from P=16.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=15.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 mainly due to CEB’s transfer of noncurrent advances to suppliers to current assets.
Consolidated total assets reached P=1.0 billion as of end of December 2021.
Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by 5.2% from P=172.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=181.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 due to higher level of deposit liabilities and bills payable of the banking business, as well as CEB’s increase in travel funds payable.
Short term debt increased 48.6% to P=66.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 from P=44.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 mainly due to URC and Petrochem’s higher short-term debt and trust receipts payable.
Long-term debt, including current portion, decreased 14.6% from P=272.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 to P=232.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 primarily due to divestment of Oceania businesses, coupled with the debt settlements made by JG Parent and RLC during the year.
