LT Group, Inc. (LTG) reported a consolidated net income attributable to equity holders of =P23.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, 42.7% higher than the P=16.2 billion recorded for the same period last year. This was on account of the improvement in the operating results of the tobacco, banking and property development segments, which more than offset the lower net income of the distilled spirits and beverage segments. The tobacco segment’s net income increased by =P6.8 billion from =P8.8 billion in 2018 to P=15.6 billion in 2019. The banking segment’s net income improved by 1.6% from P=9.8 billion for 2018 to P=9.9 billion in 2019 on account of the recorded increase in the bank’s core income comprising primarily of net interest income and net service fees and commission. Property development segment’s net income was P=900 million, 87.9% higher than the P=479 million in 2018. Distilled spirits segment’s net income was P=676 million, 25.6% less than the =P909 million recognized for the period ended December 31, 2018. The beverage segment’s net income decreased to =P398 million in the current period from P=421 million in 2018.

Consolidated revenues amounted to P=94.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, 24.6% more than the =P75.6 billion recognized in 2018 as banking, beverage and distilled spirits increased.
Cost of sales and services increased by 30.1% from P=36.0 billion for 2018 to =P46.8 billion in 2019, primarily attributable to higher interest expense incurred in deposit liabilities and increased cost of sales of the distilled spirits and beverage segments due to higher volume and raw materials cost.
Operating expenses amounted to P=35.7 billion in 2019 from =P32.5 billion in 2018 or an increase of 9.9%. This was as a result of increased general and administrative expenses by 9.8%, from =P29.8 billion in 2018 to =P32.7 billion in 2019 and higher selling expenses by 11.5%.

The tobacco segment’s net income was P=15.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, significantly higher than the =P8.8 billion for the same period last year on account of the increase in equity in net earnings from PMFTC (49.6% owned associate) from P=8.5 billion last year to =P15.4 billion in 2019. PMFTC’s income increased due to favorable mix with premium Marlboro accounting for a higher portion of sales volume and price increases implemented in late August 2019.

The banking segment’s net income was P=9.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 higher than the P=9.8 billion recorded for the same period in 2018.
Interest income from banking operations was at P=50.6 billion in 2019, 40.3% higher than the P=36.1 billion earned last year, mainly on account of the expansion in loans, interbank loans and trading and investment securities portfolios. Interest expense was at P=18.2 billion for the period ended December 31, 2019, up 101.5% from =P9.0 billion in same period of 2018 primarily due to growth in deposit liabilities and other borrowings resulting to a net interest income of P=32.5 billion, 19.9% higher year-on-year.
Net service fees and commission income improved from the previous period’s =P3.5 billion to P=4.2 billion in the current period driven by the growth in deposit and credit card related fees.
Trading and investment securities and net foreign exchange gains were higher at =P2.2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018’s =P1.1 billion. On the other hand, miscellaneous income decreased by 62.8% to P=3.2 billion from =P8.6 billion, due to lower gain from the sale of ROPA.
Operating expenses increased by 10.5% as growth in revenues particularly in interest income and trading gains translated to higher business taxes and other related administrative expenses.
The property development segment reported a net income of =P900 million for the year 2019, 87.9% greater than the P=479 million for the same period last year.
Leasing revenues in 2019 accounted for =P1.7 billion or 54.5% of revenues, representing a 14.2% increase compared to 2018, as lease contracts were renewed at higher rates for the BPO offices as well as the additional retail space at Eton Square Ortigas that was completed in 2018.
