As of December 31, 2017, the Metrobank Group posted a 10.89% growth in total assets from P1.88 trillion as of December 31, 2016 to P2.08 trillion. Total liabilities of the Group increased to P1.88 trillion from P1.67 trillion or 12.32%. Moreover, equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company increased by P5.95 billion or 3.04% from P196.00 billion to P201.96 billion due to net effect of the net income reported for the year ended December 31, 2017, higher translation adjustments, higher net unrealized loss on AFS investments driven by lower market prices, and declaration of cash dividend.
Due from BSP which represents 12.59% of the Group’s total assets increased by P23.15 billion or 9.70% due to the increase in demand deposits net of lower placements in term and overnight deposit facilities of the BSP. Due from Other Banks decreased by P13.02 billion or 29.39% as a result of the net movements in the balances maintained with various local and foreign banks. Interbank Loans Receivable and SPURA went down by P46.17 billion or 50.38% mainly due to lower balance of securities under resale agreement with BSP.
Financial Assets at FVPL which consist of held-for-trading (HFT) securities and derivative assets amounting to P37.52 billion and P6.37 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and P30.09 billion and P7.12 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 increased by P6.67 billion or 17.93% coming from both corporate and government securities. AFS investments went up by P27.06 billion or 8.54% due to higher investments in treasury notes and bonds and corporate securities.

Loans and Receivables, representing 60.83% and 56.55% of the Group’s total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, went up by P204.60 billion or 19.29% driven by the strong demand for loans from all segments. Consumer loans increased by 16.68% while commercial loans increased by 19.94%. Non-performing loans were still maintained at lower level with a ratio of 1.01% as of December 31, 2017. Investments in Associates and a Joint Venture went up by P0.41 billion or 7.74% due to the share in net income of associates during the year net of PSBank’s sale of its 10% ownership in SMFC. Investment Properties decreased by P0.76 billion or 8.93% due to continuous disposals of foreclosed real estate properties. A minimal increase of P0.59 billion or 5.95% was noted on other assets which consist of, among others, software costs, inter-office float items, creditable withholding tax and miscellaneous assets.
Deposit liabilities represent 81.44% and 83.17% of the consolidated total liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, wherein, low cost deposits represent 62.19% and 60.89% of the Group’s total deposits, respectively. The Group’s deposit level, sourced by the Bank, PSBank and MBCL reached P1.53 trillion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of P138.66 billion or 9.98% from P1.39 trillion as of December 31, 2016. The increment came from CASA by P104.14 billion or 12.31%, time deposits by P27.39 billion or 5.26% and from the issuances of LTNCDs by the Bank for P3.75 billion and by PSBank for P3.4 billion on July 20 and January 30, 2017, respectively.
Bills Payable and SSURA representing 12.14% and 9.66% of the Group’s total liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, went up by P66.46 billion or 41.18% due to higher balances of borrowings from BSP by P28.0 billion, local banks by P16.78 billion and foreign banks by P5.45 billion; deposits substitutes by P2.69 billion and SSURA by P13.54 billion. Derivative Liabilities which represent mark-to-market of foreign currency forwards, interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign currency options with negative fair value increased by P0.74 billion or 16.05%.
The increase of P1.12 billion or 16.19% in Manager’s Checks and Demand Drafts Outstanding resulted from normal banking operations of the Bank and PSBank. Income taxes payable increased by P1.20 billion or 54.74% representing additional corporate income tax due for the year. Bonds payable decreased by P8.59 billion or 74.69% due to the maturity of FMIC bonds with total face value of P9.0 billion in 2017. The early redemption of PSBank’s P3.0 billion Tier 2 Notes on February 21, 2017 accounted for the 9.97% decline in Subordinated Debts. Deferred tax liabilities decreased by P0.04 billion or 11.22%. Other Liabilities increased by P9.16 billion or 18.43% primarily due to the recognition of P14.80 billion liability on the agreed purchase of 40% stake in MCC. As discussed in Note 11 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit 3, on October 18, 2017, the Parent Company’s BOD approved and the Parent Company has entered into a purchase agreement with its joint venture partner (the Seller). On December 28, 2017, the BSP approved the transaction and with this, the purchase of 20% is deemed completed and the acquisition cost for the remaining 20% is required to be recognized for accounting purposes. Other accounts affected by the said transaction were “translation adjustment and others” and “other equity reserves.”

Net income attributable to equity holders of the Bank amounted to P18.22 billion for the year 2017 compared with P18.09 billion net income for the year 2016.
Interest income improved by P12.14 billion or 17.81% resulting from higher interest income on loans and receivables and interbank loans and SPURA by P12.13 billion and P0.33 billion, respectively, driven by the loan growth net of lower interest income on trading and investment securities by P0.31 billion. Meanwhile, the increases in interest expense on deposit liabilities by P2.72 billion and on borrowings by P0.96 billion accounted for the increase of P3.68 billion or 24.16% in interest and finance charges. These resulted in P8.46 billion or 15.98% increase net interest income.
Other operating income of P22.15 billion decreased by P3.52 billion or 13.71% from P25.67 billion in 2016 on account of lower net trading and securities and foreign exchange gains by P4.71 billion or 55.01% due to disposals of HTM investments in 2016. On the other hand, increases were noted in fee-based income by P0.72 billion or 6.93%, profit from disposal of foreclosed properties of P0.34 billion or 46.86% and income from trust operations by P0.10 billion or 8.08%.
Total operating expenses were maintained at a reasonable level with P3.05 billion or 5.87% increase from P51.94 billion in 2016 to P54.98 billion in 2017 and 2.25% higher in provision for credit and impairment losses. Increases were also noted in compensation and fringe benefits by P1.84 billion or 10.04%, taxes and licenses by P0.58 billion or 9.72% and depreciation and amortization by P0.23 billion or 7.11%. Provision for income tax was also higher by P1.37 billion or 20.66% from P6.62 billion to P7.99 billion on account of higher provision for corporate income tax.
Share in net income of associates and a joint venture increased by P0.43 billion or 163.98% due to higher net income of certain associates while income attributable to non-controlling interest went up by P0.82 billion or 36.64% with noted improvement on the results of operations of certain majority-owned subsidiaries.
Total comprehensive income went up by P3.07 billion from P13.16 billion in 2016 to P16.23 billion in 2017. The variance was attributed to the higher net income of the Group and the P2.11 billion increase in other comprehensive income particularly on the movements in translation adjustments and in remeasurement loss on retirement plan. Total comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the Bank went up to P13.37 billion from P12.43 billion in 2016.
Market share price was at P101.40 from P72.60 as of December 31, 2016 with a market capitalization of P322.47 billion as at December 31, 2017.

Metrobank’s medium term plan remains focused on sustaining and increasing market relevance through continuous improvement in customer experience, operational efficiency and people development.
The Bank is currently working on its Customer Experience (CEx) strategy, having empowered a Service Excellence Group that is governed by a committee to pursue investments and enhancements in customer touchpoints (face-to-face, branches and e-channels, documents), and more importantly, define customer satisfaction standards and spearhead customer complaints resolution.
The creation of a premium CEx proposition is backed by an ongoing service culture transformation program that is based primarily on external customer expectations.
In this light, Process and IT capabilities - particularly its digital platform - and people resources are being prepared to ensure the delivery of the envisioned CEx promise. Investments in analytics, automation, product and channel development, and skill and mindset programs have been made to allow people and technology to work together.

The Bank will continue to actively improve on the Group's strong capital position. The Bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The Bank also concluded a series of measures to prepare for Basel III implementation.
In 2006, the Bank issued US$125.0 million Hybrid Tier 1 capital security in February and 173,618,400 common shares at P38.00 per common share in October. In May 2010, the Bank raised an additional P5.0 billion in capital through a private placement of common shares. In January 2011, the Bank raised approximately US$220.0 million through a rights offer for 200 million common shares at the offer price of P50.00 per rights share. In August 2013, the Bank increased its capital stock from P50 billion to P100 billion and on September 16, 2013, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 633,415,805 common shares (with a par value of P20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock, which further improved the Bank’s capital position. In April 2015, the Bank raised approximately P32.0 billion through a rights offer for 435,371,720 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P73.50 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 7, 2015.
The Bank also issued Tier 2 instruments to boost its capital adequacy ratio. The Bank issued Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated notes in October 2007 for P8.5 billion with a coupon of 7.0%; in October 2008 for P5.5 billion with a coupon of 7.75%; and in May 2009 for P4.5 billion with a coupon of 7.5%. With the advent of Basel III, the Bank subsequently redeemed these previously issued subordinated debt issuances as they would not have been considered as capital beginning January 1, 2014. The Bank exercised the call option on its P8.5 billion 7.0%; P5.5 billion 7.75% and P4.5 billion 7.5% Lower Tier 2 Notes on October 22, 2012, October 4, 2013 and May 6, 2014, respectively. The early redemptions of these instruments were in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes when they were originally issued. By redeeming the notes, the Bank avoided a step-up in the interest rate and the capital decay from the instruments. In 2014, the Bank raised a total of P22.5 billion in subordinated debt wherein P16.0 billion was issued on March 27, 2014 at a coupon rate of 5.375% and P6.5 billion on August 8, 2014 at 5.25%. The terms of the notes contain a loss absorption feature, allowing them to be recognized as bank capital in accordance with Basel III standards. The transactions were done in part to replace the Basel II Tier 2 notes which were redeemed on their call option dates.
Basel III penalizes banks for their holdings in non-allied undertakings. As such, during the period 2012-2016, the Group has actively sought to divest itself of such undertakings and strengthen its standing under Basel III. These transactions included the sale of the Bank’s ownership in TMPC in tranches between 2012 and 2013 as well as the sale of FMIC’s holdings in GBPC in tranches between 2013 and 2016 and FMIC’s holdings in Charter Ping An Insurance Corporation in 2014. In 2014, the Bank and PSBank also disposed of its holdings in TFSPC. Altogether, these sales further improved the Bank’s CAR position under Basel III. The Group continues to review its holdings in non-allied undertakings and may consider selling additional stakes as necessary.

The Philippine economy capped 2017 with another solid finish of 6.7% from 6.9% in 2016. For 2017, the Philippines is still the fastest economy in the ASEAN region and is just behind China, which posted a full-year growth of 6.9%. The still strong expansion for the year could be mainly attributed to recovery of the Exports sector, sustained Government expenditures, vibrant Industry sector, and rebound of the Agri sector.
The BSP kept policy rates steady as inflation throughout the year as inflation remained manageable to average at 3.2%. Domestic consumer prices slowly inched up amid base effects and volatile global crude oil prices. Global oil prices jumped amid the agreements by oil producers to reduce output and the improving outlook for some of the major advanced economies. Broad-based economic recovery is expected to underpin higher global commodity prices amid the strengthening demand and tightening supply.
Interest rates are on a slow rise amid the upside pressure on inflation and anticipation for subsequent US Fed rate hikes. The US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate three times in 2017 on the back of an improving economy and labor market.
The PSEi also capped the year on a high note, gaining a total of 25.1% for the year, on investor optimism over the government’s infra spending, tax reform package, and the generally favorable global financial market. The local stock exchange came in at 8,558.42, its best finish for the year, during the last trading session of 2017.
The Philippine peso see-sawed between the levels of P49 to P52 from January until mid-November, but ended the year just slightly lower than the start of the year close. The surprise end of the year close of P49.93 was a strong finish for the peso amid positive investor sentiment on the passing of the first package of the tax reform program, seasonal surge of OFW remittances, and strong portfolio inflows.
Economic momentum is largely holding up in the world’s largest economies, the effects of which are reverberating across the globe. The global economy is benefiting from a combination of loose financial conditions, more supportive fiscal policies in some key countries following years of harsh fiscal consolidation, low inflation and strong global trade.
The growth in 2017 shows that the Philippine economy is on a solid footing and could likely be poised to achieve even faster expansion in 2018. Growth is expected to be supported by a pickup in household spending, sustained growth in government spending, robust Industry and Services sectors, and continued strong expansion of the export sector. Expected revenues from the government’s Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law would ensure that the government has enough spending power for the Build Build Build program and could likely translate to sustained higher GDP growth in the coming years. However, risks to the domestic economy remain amid the effects of the still diverse global economic growth and impact of financial market volatilities.

To ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the Bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. Based on this system of monitoring, the Bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2017, the contractual maturity profile shows that the Bank has at its disposal about P866.03 billion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. This will cover 67.41% of the P1.29 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. These cash inflows exclude AFS investments with maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. Inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 87.34% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. On the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

In the normal course of the Group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. No material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.

For the year 2018, the Bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about P3.0 to P5.0 billion, of which 60% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.

The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. Except as otherwise indicated, the Group does not expect the adoption of these new and amended PFRS and Philippine Interpretations to have significant impact on its financial statements. The Group will assess impact of these amendments on its financial position or performance when they become effective.
