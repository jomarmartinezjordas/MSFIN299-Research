As of December 31, 2018, the Metrobank Group posted a 7.85% growth in total assets from P2.08 trillion as of December 31, 2017 to P2.24 trillion. Total liabilities of the Group increased to P1.95 trillion from P1.88 trillion or by 4.09%. Moreover, equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company was higher by P81.01 billion or 40.11% from P201.96 billion to P282.96 billion.
Cash and Other Cash Items increased by P5.46 billion or 19.76% due to the higher level of cash requirements of the Parent Company. Due from BSP which represents 10.70% of the Group’s total assets decreased by P21.83 billion or 8.33% due to reserve cuts in 2018. Due from Other Banks increased by P14.51 billion or 46.37% as a result of the net movements in the balances maintained with various local and foreign banks. Interbank Loans Receivable and SPURA went up by P5.24 billion or 11.53% primarily due to increase in balance of securities under resale agreement with BSP.
Total investment securities which consisted of FVTPL, FVOCI (AFS in 2017) and securities at amortized cost which represents 18.56% and 18.64% of the Group’s total assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, went up by P28.56 billion or 7.36%. As a result of the adoption of the classification and measurement requirements of PFRS 9, the Group classified debt securities held under AFS investments as at January 1, 2018 as either at amortized cost for securities belonging to portfolios managed under a hold to collect business model or at FVOCI.
Loans and Receivables, representing 62.0% and 60.83% of the Group’s total assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, went up by P125.57 billion or 9.92% driven by the strong demand for loans from all segments. Non-performing loans were at 1.20% as of December 31, 2018. Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) increased by P1.08 billion or 11.76% primarily attributable to allowance for credit and impairment losses. Other Assets increased by P5.26 billion or 50.21% from P10.47 billion to P15.72 billion primarily due to the increases in miscellaneous assets (inclusive of the funding for retirement) and interoffice float items.
Deposit liabilities represent 79.71% and 81.44% of the consolidated total liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, wherein, low cost deposits represent 61.98% and 62.19% of the Group’s total deposits, respectively. The Group’s deposit level, sourced by the Bank, PSBank and MBCL reached P1.56 trillion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of P28.79 billion or 1.88% from P1.53 trillion as of December 31, 2017. The increment came from CASA by P14.73 billion or 1.55%, time deposits by P0.30 billion or 0.05% and from the issuances of LTNCDs by the Bank for P8.68 billion and by PSBank for P5.08 billion on October 4 and August 9, 2018, respectively.
Bills Payable and SSURA representing 13.29% and 12.14% of the Group’s total liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, went up by P31.77 billion or 13.95% due to the net effect of higher balances of borrowings from foreign banks by P18.48 billion, local banks by P4.07 billion and SSURA by P30.67 billion reduced by the decreases in borrowings from BSP by P6.50 billion and deposits substitutes by P14.95 billion. Derivative Liabilities which represent mark-to-market of foreign currency forwards, interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign currency options with negative fair value increased by P1.19 billion or 22.14%.
The decrease of P0.49 billion or 6.07% in Manager’s Checks and Demand Drafts Outstanding resulted from normal banking operations of the Bank and PSBank. Income taxes payable decreased by P0.55 billion or 16.30% while Accrued Interest and Other Expenses went up by P2.65 billion or 37.95% due to increases in accruals of other bank expenses and interests on deposit liabilities. Bonds payable increased by P27.83 billion on account of the P10.00 billion and P18.00 billion fixed rate bonds issued by the Parent Company on November 9 and December 17, 2018, respectively, which bear an interest rate of 7.15% per annum and will mature on November 9, 2020. Deferred tax liabilities increased by P0.08 billion or 28.88%. Non-equity Non-controlling Interest representing the portion of net income and net assets of the mutual fund subsidiaries of FMIC not attributed to the Group went down by P1.26 billion or 15.68% on account of the net decline in income of these mutual funds.
Other Liabilities decreased by P13.26 billion or 22.53% primarily due to the settlement of the P14.80 billion liability on the agreed purchase of 40% stake in MCC and the funding of the P3.40 billion retirement liability, partially offset by the P1.00 billion increase in marginal deposits and the P2.60 billion unsecured notes issued by ORIX Metro on October 29, 2018.
Equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company increased by P81.01 billion or 40.11% due to the net effect of the P59.1 billion net proceeds from the stock rights issued by the Parent Company on April 12, 2018, net income reported during the year, net impact of PFRS 9 adoption on Surplus and net unrealized loss on FVOCI/AFS investments, and the P3.18 billion cash dividends declared and paid during the year. The Group also recognized additional equity reserves (included in “Translation adjustment and others”) for the difference between the acquisition price and the acquired remaining non-controlling interest of 20% in MCC. The acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in MCC was completed on September 4, 2018 (“second tranche”) and the Group recognized equity reserves (included in “Translation adjustment and others”) for the difference between the acquisition price and the acquired non-controlling interest amounting to P5.1 billion. Other accounts affected by this transaction were “other equity reserves” and “non-controlling interest”.

Net income attributable to equity holders of the Bank amounted to P22.01 billion for the year 2018 compared with P18.22 billion net income for the year 2017.
Interest income improved by P16.86 billion or 21.00% resulting from higher interest income on loans and receivables by P16.27 billion and on total investment securities by P0.72 billion net of the P0.14 billion decrease in interest income on interbank loans and SPURA. Meanwhile, the increases in interest expense on deposit liabilities by P6.36 billion and on borrowings by P3.09 billion accounted for the increase of P9.45 billion or 49.95% in interest and finance charges. These resulted to a P7.42 billion or 12.08% increase net interest income.
Other operating income of P22.91 billion increased by P0.76 billion or 3.45% from P22.15 billion in 2017 on account of the increases in fee-based income by P1.65 billion, income from leasing by P0.12 billion and profit from disposal of foreclosed properties by P0.30 billion, reduced by lower net trading and securities and foreign exchange gains by P1.10 billion.
Provision for credit and impairment losses in 2018 was at P7.77 billion under PFRS 9 compared with P7.51 billion in 2017 under PAS 39 or increased by P0.26 billion or 3.50%. Total other operating expenses increased by P6.18 billion or 13.02% as a result of the increases in compensation and fringe benefits by P2.15 billion or 10.63%, taxes and licenses by P2.20 billion or 33.37% (as a result of changes on tax rates, particularly on documentary stamp taxes, brought about by the implementation of the TRAIN law in 2018), occupancy and equipment-related expenses by P0.26 billion or 9.01% and miscellaneous expenses by P1.51 billion or 10.96%. Provision for income tax was lower by P0.25 billion or 3.07% due to net movements in deferred income tax, corporate and final taxes.
Share in net income of associates and a joint venture increased by P0.19 billion or 26.85% due to higher net income of certain associates while income attributable to non-controlling interest went down by P1.62 billion or 53.17% due to the effect of the acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in MCC.
Total comprehensive income went up by P4.56 billion from P16.23 billion income in 2017 to P20.78 billion in 2018. The variance was attributable to the higher net income of the Group and the lower net unrealized loss recognized on investment securities. As a result, total comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company went up to P19.67 billion or by P6.30 billion from P13.37 billion in 2017.
Market share price was at P80.95 from P101.40 as of December 31, 2017 with a market capitalization of P322.18 billion as at December 31, 2018.

Apart from the focus on sustaining and increasing market relevance through continuous improvement in customer experience, operational efficiency and people development, Metrobank is deepening its commitment to instilling financial discipline across new and underserved markets, and exploring venues outside its current CSR activities by which it can increase its socio economic impact.
The Bank relaunched its Core Values program around PITCH: Passion for Results, Integrity, Teamwork, Commitment to Customer Service and Heart for Community - as a reinforcement of the work ethic and institutional values it wants to embed amidst changing dynamics of the work force. Moreover, the Bank believes that developing its people to be capable of delivering the “You’re in the Good Hands” promise to each customer will rely on a sustainable culture transformation and change management program, a robust IT infrastructure, and sound control and risk management practices. Thus, investments in people are further backed by investments in IT and information security, process efficiencies, and risk and control systems.

The Bank will continue to actively improve on the Group's strong capital position. The Bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The Bank also has had a series of measures to prepare for Basel III implementation.
In 2006, the Bank issued US$125.0 million Hybrid Tier 1 capital security in February and 173,618,400 common shares at P38.00 per common share in October. In May 2010, the Bank raised an additional P5.0 billion in capital through a private placement of common shares. In January 2011, the Bank raised approximately US$220.0 million through a rights offer for 200 million common shares at the offer price of P50.00 per rights share. In August 2013, the Bank increased its capital stock from P50 billion to P100 billion and on September 16, 2013 and issued a stock dividend equivalent to 633,415,805 common shares (with a par value of P20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock, which further improved the Bank’s capital position. In April 2015, the Bank raised P32.0 billion through a rights offer for 435,371,720 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P73.50 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 7, 2015. Further, in April 2018, the Bank raised P60.0 billion through a rights offer for 799,842,250 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P75.00 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 12, 2018.
The Bank also issued Tier 2 instruments to boost its capital adequacy ratio. The Bank issued Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated notes in October 2007 for P8.5 billion with a coupon of 7.0%; in October 2008 for P5.5 billion with a coupon of 7.75%; and in May 2009 for P4.5 billion with a coupon of 7.5%. With the advent of Basel III, the Bank subsequently redeemed these previously issued subordinated debt issuances as they would not have been considered as capital beginning January 1, 2014. The Bank exercised the call option on its P8.5 billion 7.0%; P5.5 billion 7.75% and P4.5 billion 7.5% Lower Tier 2 Notes on October 22, 2012, October 4, 2013 and May 6, 2014, respectively. The early redemptions of these instruments were in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes when they were originally issued. By redeeming the notes, the Bank avoided a step-up in the interest rate and the capital decay from the instruments. In 2014, the Bank raised a total of P22.5 billion in subordinated debt wherein P16.0 billion was issued on March 27, 2014 at a coupon rate of 5.375% and P6.5 billion on August 8, 2014 at 5.25%. The terms of the notes contain a loss absorption feature, allowing them to be recognized as bank capital in accordance with Basel III standards. The transactions were done in part to replace the Basel II Tier 2 notes which were redeemed on their call option dates.
Basel III penalizes banks for their holdings in non-allied undertakings. As such, during the period 2012-2016, the Group has actively sought to divest itself of such undertakings and strengthen its standing under Basel III. These transactions included the sale of the Bank’s ownership in Toyota Motor Philippines Corporation in tranches between 2012 and 2013 as well as the sale of FMIC’s holdings in Global Business Power Corporation in tranches between 2013 and 2016 and FMIC’s holdings in Charter Ping An Insurance Corporation in 2014. In 2014, the Bank and PSBank also disposed of its holdings in Toyota Financial Services Philippines Corporation. Altogether, these sales further improved the Bank’s CAR position under Basel III. The Group continues to review its holdings in non-allied undertakings and may consider selling additional stakes as necessary.

The Philippines remained a dynamic performer in the region, consistently posting above 6% growth since 2016. The economy grew by an average of 6.2% in 2018, the third fastest expansion in the ASEAN region including China, on the back of sustained pickup in government spending, strong investment spending, and solid services sector.
2018 saw domestic consumer prices rise to its highest level in nine years amid the impact of rice supply disruptions and volatile global crude oil prices. Inflation, which averaged at 5.2% in 2018 compared to 2.9% in 2017, was largely influenced by the heavily-weighted Food index that experienced supply bottlenecks. Global oil prices, on the other hand, were on a steady climb since the start of the year and reached its peak in October, with WTI and Brent crude hitting $75 per barrel and $85 per barrel, respectively. Expectation of a modest global economic growth in 2019 is seen to underpin softer global commodity prices.
Consequently, interest rates were on a slow rise amid the upside pressure on inflation and in anticipation of subsequent US Fed rate hikes. The US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate four times in 2018 on the back of an improving economy and labor market. The BSP, meanwhile, hiked policy rates five times, raising rates by a total of 175 basis points to address the second-round impact of inflation.
The Philippine peso, like other emerging market currencies, was on a depreciation trend since the start of the year, weighed down by significant risk events like widening current account deficit, US Fed rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions.
Following a robust expansion in 2017, the global economy managed to cap 2018 on a still solid footing. For most of the year, the performance of many major economies has been strong while some emerging economies faced headwinds. The US economy continued to show improving fundamentals, while the Eurozone posted solid growth in the first half of the year. A number of emerging economies, on the other hand, experienced some setbacks as reflected by sharp currency depreciations. Nevertheless, economic dynamics in Asia were fairly solid, supported by strong labor markets and robust domestic demand. Risks to the outlook, however, continue to mount, especially stemming from the escalating US-China trade conflict.
In the domestic front, the continuous increases in government and investment spending should keep growth above the 6% level. Sustained infrastructure outlays will continue to underpin the expansion in investment spending. The government’s infra program will open more opportunities for the private sector to expand business activities and increase capital spending. Furthermore, consumption spending is expected to be higher in 2019 amid the continued easing in inflation.

To ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the Bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. Based on this system of monitoring, the Bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2018, the contractual maturity profile shows that the Bank has at its disposal about P918.10 billion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. This will cover 71.22% of the P1.29 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. These cash inflows exclude securities booked in FVTPL and FVOCI whose maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. Inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 77.07% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. On the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

In the normal course of the Group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. No material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.

For the year 2019, the Bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about P2.0 to P4.0 billion, of which 50% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.

Standards issued but not yet effective up to date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed in Note 2 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit 4. The listing consists of standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. Except as otherwise indicated, the Group does not expect the adoption of these new and amended PFRS and Philippine Interpretations to have significant impact on its financial statements. The Group will assess impact of these amendments on its financial position or performance when they become effective.
