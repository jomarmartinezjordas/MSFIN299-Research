As of December 31, 2019, the Metrobank Group posted a 9.23% growth in total assets from P2.24 trillion as of December 31, 2018 to P2.45 trillion.

Due from BSP which represents 8.98% of the Group’s total assets decreased by 8.39% due to the various reserve cuts in 2019. Due from Other Banks increased by P8.97 billion or 19.57% as a result of the net movements in the balances maintained with various local and foreign banks. Interbank Loans Receivable and SPURA went up by P21.46 billion or 42.30% primarily due to the increase in securities under resale agreement with the BSP.
Total investment securities which consisted of FVTPL, FVOCI and securities at amortized cost and represents 21.05% and 18.56% of the Group’s total assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, went up by P99.66 billion or 23.94%.

The P91.23 billion increase in FVOCI securities was mainly due to the net effect of the increases in investments in government bonds (P25.87 billion) and treasury notes and bonds (P71.01 billion). On the other hand, the P13.75 billion decrease in investment securities at amortized cost was due to various maturities and FMIC’s disposal of HTC debt securities as discussed in Note 8 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit 4.
Loans and Receivables, representing 60.53% and 62.0% of the Group’s total assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, went up by P92.53 billion or 6.65% driven by the strong demand for loans from all segments. Non-performing loans were at 1.30% of the total receivables from customers as of December 31, 2019. Investments in Associates and a Joint Venture went up by P0.64 billion or 10.83% due to the share in net income and other comprehensive income of the associates of FMIC. Property and equipment increased by P3.75 billion or 17.06% from P21.95 billion to P25.70 billion resulting from the adoption of PFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019 which requires recognition by lessees of the assets and related liabilities for most leases on their balance sheets and subsequently depreciates the lease assets and recognizes interest on the lease liabilities in their profit or loss. Upon adoption, initial recognition of right-of-use asset classified under “Property and Equipment” amounted to P4.2 billion and lease liability classified under “Other Liabilities” amounted to P4.5 billion.
Deposit liabilities represent 80.39% and 79.71% of the consolidated total liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, wherein, low cost deposits represent 62.86% and 61.98% of the Group’s total deposits, respectively. The Group’s deposit level, sourced by the Bank, PSBank and MBCL reached P1.71 trillion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of P157.39 billion or 10.11% from P1.56 trillion as of December 31, 2018.

Derivative Liabilities which represent mark-to-market of foreign currency forwards, interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, credit default swaps and foreign currency options with negative fair value increased by P0.89 billion or 13.61%.
The decrease of P0.76 billion or 10.03% in Manager’s Checks and Demand Drafts Outstanding resulted from normal banking operations of the Bank and PSBank. Income taxes payable increased by P1.36 billion or 47.99% while Accrued Interest and Other Expenses went up by P0.88 billion or 9.15% due to increase in accruals of other bank expenses. Bonds payable increased by P49.74 billion or 161.80% on account of the P17.50 billion, P11.25 billion and P13.75 billion fixed rate bonds issued by the Parent Company on April 11, 2019, July 3, 2019 and October 24, 2019, respectively; the P6.30 billion fixed rate bonds issued by PSBank on July 24, 2019; and the P4.16 billion fixed rate bonds issued by ORIX Metro on November 15, 2019 reduced by the maturity of the P2.92 billion fixed rate bonds of FMIC in August 2019. Details of these bonds are discussed in Note 19 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit 4. On June 27, 2019 and August 23, 2019, the Parent Company and PSBank redeemed their 2024 Peso Notes amounting to P16.0 billion and P3.0 billion, respectively, ahead of its maturity, which caused the decrease in Subordinated Debts. Deferred tax liabilities decreased by P0.25 billion or 69.75%.
Other Liabilities increased by P10.56 billion or 23.14% primarily due to the recognition of lease liability as a result of the adoption of PFRS 16 (P4.04 billion) and increases in marginal deposits (P2.14 billion), bills purchased contra (P1.92 billion) and accounts payable (P1.81 billion).
The P1.19 billion or 15.40% increase in equity of non-controlling interest was attributed to the net income generated by the majority-owned subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the net effect of PSBank’s stock rights in January 2019 and the increase in the ownership of the Bank. Equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company increased by P26.59 billion or 9.40% mainly due to the net effect of the net income reported during the year and improvement in net unrealized gain on FVOCI.

Net income attributable to equity holders of the Bank amounted to P28.06 billion for the year 2019 or 27.48% higher compared with P22.01 billion net income for the year 2018.
Interest income improved by P19.0 billion or 19.55% resulting from higher interest income on loans and receivables by P16.19 billion, on investment securities at FVTPL and FVOCI by P2.73 billion and on deposit with banks and others by P0.23 billion. Meanwhile, higher interest expense on deposit liabilities by P4.44 billion and on borrowings by P6.38 billion accounted for the increase of P10.82 billion or 38.15% in interest and finance charges. These resulted to a P8.18 billion or 11.88% improvement on net interest income.
Other operating income of P29.05 billion increased by P6.14 billion or 26.82% from P22.91 billion in 2018 on account of higher net trading and securities and foreign exchange gains by P6.52 billion and fee-based income by P1.57 billion reduced by the P1.01 billion lower miscellaneous income.
Total operating expenses increased by P4.25 billion or 7.92% from P53.66 billion to P57.91 billion with higher compensation and fringe benefits by P1.34 billion or 5.98%, taxes and licenses by P1.44 billion or 16.44%, depreciation and amortization of P1.45 billion or 35.60%, of which P1.30 billion pertains to the depreciation expense recognized in 2019 due to the adoption of PFRS 16 (resulted in the decline in occupancy and equipment related expenses by P1.33 billion), and miscellaneous expenses by P1.34 billion or 8.80%. Provision for credit and impairment losses increased by P2.31 billion from P7.77 billion to P10.08 billion and provision for income tax was higher by P2.32 billion from P7.75 billion to P10.06 billion due to net movements in corporate, final and deferred income taxes.
Income attributable to non-controlling interests went down to P0.82 billion from P1.43 billion or by P0.61 billion or 42.61% due to decrease in ownership of minority particularly on MCC and PSBank.
Total comprehensive income went up by P11.76 billion from P20.78 billion to P32.54 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, due to the net effect of the increase in net income; the net unrealized gain recognized this year on FVOCI investments compared with the net unrealized loss recognized in previous year; and the loss recognized in retirement liability. Total comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company for the year ended December 31, 2019, went up to P31.21 billion or by P11.55 billion from P19.67 billion for the same year in 2018.
Market share price was at P66.30 from P80.95 as of December 31, 2018 with a market capitalization of P298.18 billion as at December 31, 2019.

A year after the Bank’s 2018 relaunch of its Core Values program, the Bank introduced the Meaningful Banking campaign first to its employees as reinforcement of the work ethic and institutional values in their daily lives, then to the public as testament to its commitment of delivering the “You’re in Good Hands” promise to each client. The Bank plans to continue this to sustain and increase market relevance, alongside with continuous improvement in customer experience, products and services, operational efficiency and people development. Moreover, the Bank aims to deepen its commitment to instill financial discipline across new and underserved markets, and explore venues outside its current CSR activities by which it can increase its socio-economic impact.
All these will rely on a sustainable culture transformation and change management program, a robust IT infrastructure, and sound control and risk management practices. Thus, investments in people are further backed by investments in IT and information security, process efficiencies, and risk and control systems.

The Bank will continue to actively improve on the Group's strong capital position. The Bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
In 2006, the Bank issued US$125.0 million Hybrid Tier 1 capital security in February and 173,618,400 common shares at P38.00 per common share in October. In May 2010, the Bank raised an additional P5.0 billion in capital through a private placement of common shares. In January 2011, the Bank raised approximately US$220.0 million through a rights offer for 200 million common shares at the offer price of P50.00 per rights share. In August 2013, the Bank increased its capital stock from P50 billion to P100 billion and on September 16, 2013, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 633,415,805 common shares (with a par value of P20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock. In April 2015, the Bank raised P32.0 billion through a rights offer for 435,371,720 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P73.50 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 7, 2015. Further, in April 2018, the Bank raised P60.0 billion through a rights offer for 799,842,250 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P75.00 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 12, 2018. In October 2019, the Bank increased its capital stock from P100 billion to P140 billion and on November 26, 2019, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 517,401,955 common shares (with a par value of P20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock, which further improved the Bank’s capital position.
The Bank also issued Tier 2 instruments to boost its capital adequacy ratio. The Bank issued Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated notes in October 2007 for P8.5 billion with a coupon of 7.0%; in October 2008 for P5.5 billion with a coupon of 7.75%; and in May 2009 for P4.5 billion with a coupon of 7.5%. With the advent of Basel III, the Bank subsequently redeemed these previously issued subordinated debt issuances as they would not have been considered as capital beginning January 1, 2014. The Bank exercised the call option on its P8.5 billion 7.0%; P5.5 billion 7.75% and P4.5 billion 7.5% Lower Tier 2 Notes on October 22, 2012, October 4, 2013 and May 6, 2014, respectively. The early redemptions of these instruments were in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes when they were originally issued. By redeeming the notes, the Bank avoided a step-up in the interest rate and the capital decay from the instruments. In 2014, the Bank raised a total of P22.5 billion in subordinated debt wherein P16.0 billion was issued on March 27, 2014 at a coupon rate of 5.375% and P6.5 billion on August 8, 2014 at 5.25%. The terms of the notes contain a loss absorption feature, allowing them to be recognized as bank capital in accordance with Basel III standards. The transactions were done in part to replace the Basel II Tier 2 notes which were redeemed on their call option dates. As approved by the BSP on April 25, 2019, on June 27, 2019, the Bank redeemed its 2024 Peso Notes amounting to P16.0 billion, ahead of its maturity.
As part of the Group’s capital efficiency initiatives, the Group has been active in optimizing its allied and non-allied undertakings. Among the initiatives include the sale of the Bank’s ownership in Toyota Motor Philippines Corporation in tranches between 2012 and 2013 as well as the sale of FMIC’s holdings in Global Business Power Corporation in tranches between 2013 and 2016 and FMIC’s holdings in Charter Ping An Insurance Corporation in 2014. In 2014, the Bank and PSBank also disposed of its holdings in Toyota Financial Services Philippines Corporation. Altogether, these sales further improved the Bank’s capital adequacy under Basel III. As discussed in Part I - Business item number 2 “Description of Business-Business of Registrant”, on March 13, 2019, the respective BODs of the Bank and MCC approved the proposal to merge MCC into the Bank. The proposed merger was ratified by the stockholders of the Bank on April 24, 2019, approved by the BSP on October 23, 2019, and approved by the SEC on January 3, 2020.
As of December 31, 2019, the Group’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio are 17.49% and 16.19%, respectively, both well above the regulatory requirements.

Philippine economic growth capped 2019 still above the 6% level as fourth quarter growth came in at 6.4%. Full-year average real GDP growth is at 5.9% from 6.2% in 2018. Despite the full-year average coming in short of the government’s target for the year, the economy still managed to post a solid growth in the last quarter even amid the negative developments in the global economy during the period and despite the sustained slowdowns in some of its ASEAN peers. The expansion in the fourth quarter could be mainly attributed to accelerated Government expenditures, solid Household spending, vibrant Service sector, and tempered Net Trade drag.
Full-year average inflation came in lower at 2.5% compared to 5.2% in 2018 on the back of sustained easing in the prices key food items, especially rice, and stable global crude oil prices. The Rice Tariffication Law helped bring down domestic rice prices, while Brent crude stayed in the $60 per barrel level through most of the year.
Consequently, domestic interest rates also declined on improving liquidity condition, benign inflation expectations, and subsequent policy rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve and the BSP. The Fed slashed the federal funds rate three times in 2019 to support the US economy, while the BSP cut key policy rates by a total of 75 basis points amid the sustained easing in domestic inflation. Furthermore, the BSP reduced the universal and commercial banks’ reserve requirement ratio by a total of 400 basis points to help improve domestic liquidity and also support economic growth.
Concerns over a slowing global economy, US Fed policy decisions, and the US-China trade war were the main factors that influenced the global financial market. The Philippine peso, however, remained relatively stable and even appreciated by 4% as of end-2019 amid peso-positive factors like benign inflation, robust international reserves, and solid remittance inflows.
Heightened trade tensions negatively impacted the global economy through most of 2019 as the tit-for-tat trade dispute dampened economic activity and eroded business confidence in most of the world’s economies. For 2020, the global economy is seen to stage a rebound as trade and investment gradually recover. Nevertheless, downside risks like geopolitical tensions and financial market volatility remain.
The outlook for the Philippine economy, meanwhile, remains bullish amid expectations of still solid household spending, accelerated government spending, and recovery in investment spending. The timely approval of the 2020 national budget gives the government enough spending power to fast-track infra projects and guarantees the faster growth of construction activities in the different regions of the country. Solid domestic demand will help shield the Philippine economy from negative external developments.

To ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the Bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. Based on this system of monitoring, the Bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2019, the contractual maturity profile shows that the Bank has at its disposal about P984.43 billion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. This will cover 66.89% of the P1.47 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. These cash inflows exclude securities booked in FVTPL and FVOCI whose maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. Inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 82.0% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. On the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

In the normal course of the Group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. No material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.

For the year 2020, the Bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about P3.0 to P5.0 billion, of which 50% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.
