As of December 31, 2020, the Metrobank Group posted a total assets of P2.46 trillion or higher by P4.35 billion compared with P2.45 trillion as of December 31, 2019. Total liabilities of the Group decreased to P2.12 trillion from P2.13 trillion or by P10.33 billion. On the other hand, equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company was higher by P14.65 billion from P309.55 billion to P324.20 billion.
Cash and Other Cash Items increased by P5.51 billion or 16.73%. Due from BSP which represents 12.42% of the Group’s total assets increased by 38.60% due to the net effect of the increase in overnight deposit facility placement and term deposit with the BSP and lower reserve requirement. Due from Other Banks decreased by P16.53 billion or 30.19% as a result of the net movements in the balances maintained with various local and foreign banks. Interbank Loans Receivable and SPURA went up by P7.22 billion or 10.0% due to the P20.25 billion increase in interbank loans receivable reduced by the P13.03 billion decrease in securities under resale agreement with the BSP.
Total investment securities which consisted of FVTPL, FVOCI and securities at amortized cost and represents 27.30% and 21.05% of the Group’s total assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, went up by P154.27 billion or 29.90%. FVTPL securities consist of HFT securities and derivative assets amounting to P65.71 billion and P11.85 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and P53.38 billion and P8.49 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. The P366.93 billion increase in FVOCI securities was mainly due to the net effect of the increases in investments in treasury notes and bonds (P230.56 billion), treasury bills (P81.50 billion) and BSP bonds (P30.05 billion). In 2020, the Group disposed of investment securities at amortized cost as discussed in Note 8 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit B.
Net loans and receivables, representing 51.03% and 60.53% of the Group’s total assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, went down by P230.64 billion or 15.55% due to lower portfolios of corporate, commercial and consumer loans. Investments in Associates and a Joint Venture went down by P0.34 billion or 5.20% due to lower net income and other comprehensive income of the associates and a joint venture. Deferred Tax Assets increased by P3.52 billion or 33.45% due to movements on temporary tax differences. Other Assets decreased by P2.39 billion or 15.35% from P15.57 billion to P13.18 billion primarily due to the decreases in interoffice float items and creditable withholding tax.

Deposit liabilities represent 84.69% and 80.39% of the consolidated total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, wherein, low cost deposits represent 72.97% and 62.86% of the Group’s total deposits, respectively. The Group’s deposit level, sourced by the Bank, PSBank and MBCL reached P1.80 trillion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of P83.07 billion or 4.85% from P1.71 trillion as of December 31, 2019. The increment came from demand and savings by P103.51billion and P130.35 billion, respectively, while time deposits went down by P142.79 billion. Further, the P8.00 billion long-term negotiable certificates of deposits of the Parent Company had matured in April 2020.
Bills Payable and SSURA representing 6.58% and 11.17% of the Group’s total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, went down by P98.67 billion or 41.41% due to the net effect of lower borrowings from foreign banks by P38.43 billion, local banks by P7.81 billion and deposit substitutes by P53.99 billion offset by the P1.57 billion increase in SSURA. Derivative Liabilities which represent mark-to-market of foreign currency forwards, interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, credit default swaps and foreign currency options with negative fair value increased by P6.04 billion or 81.30%.
The decrease of P0.78 billion or 11.49% in Manager’s Checks and Demand Drafts Outstanding resulted from normal banking operations of the Bank and PSBank. Income taxes payable decreased by P1.48 billion or 35.27% and Accrued Interest and Other Expenses went down by P1.35 billion or 12.86% due to decrease in accruals of interest expenses. Bonds payable increased by P10.91 billion or 13.56% on account of the P4.65 billion fixed rate bonds issued by PSBank, the P10.50 billion fixed rate bonds and USD500 million senior unsecured notes net of the maturity of P28.0 billion fixed rate bonds issued by the Parent Company. Details of these bonds are discussed in Note 19 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit B. On August 8, 2020, the Parent Company redeemed its 2025 Notes ahead of its maturity, which caused the decrease in Subordinated Debts.
Non-equity Non-controlling Interest representing the portion of net income and net assets of the mutual fund subsidiaries of FMIC not attributed to the Group went up by P1.76 billion or 26.89% due to the net effect of the increase in income and the decrease in ownership of these mutual funds. Other Liabilities decreased by P3.35 billion or 5.95% primarily due to the decreases in bills purchased contra (P3.10 billion), notes payable (maturity in 2020 of the unsecured notes issued by ORIX Metro amounting to P2.59 billion) and marginal deposits (P0.77 billion) offset by the increases in accounts payable (P2.59 billion) and miscellaneous liabilities (P2.84 billion).
Equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company increased by P14.65 billion or 4.73% mainly due to the net income reported during the year and improvement in net unrealized gain on investment securities at FVOCI.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income went down by P8.40 billion or 7.23% resulting from lower interest income on loans and receivables by P10.16 billion partially offset by the improvements in interest income on investment securities by P0.54 billion and on interbank loans receivable, deposit with banks and others by P1.22 billion. Meanwhile, lower interest expense on deposit liabilities by P12.08 billion and on borrowings by P5.43 billion accounted for the decrease of P17.51 billion or 44.67% in interest and finance charges. These resulted to a P9.11 billion or 11.83% improvement on net interest income.
Other operating income of P35.13 billion increased by P6.08 billion or 20.91% from P29.05 billion in 2019 on account of higher net trading and securities and gain by P1.24 billion and foreign exchange gain by P0.61 billion net of the decreases in fee-based income by P2.56 billion and miscellaneous income by P0.73 billion. The disposal of investment securities at amortized cost by the Group in 2020 (as discussed in Note 8 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit B) resulted to a gain of P8.18 billion.
Total operating expenses increased by P2.21 billion or 3.82% from P57.91 billion to P60.12 billion with higher compensation and fringe benefits by P1.18 billion or 4.99%, occupancy and equipment-related costs by P0.21 billion or 11.41% and miscellaneous expenses by P1.10 billion or 6.66%. To recognize the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s provision for credit and impairment losses was increased to P40.76 billion from P10.08 billion in previous year. Provision for income tax was lower by P3.02 billion from P10.06 billion to P7.05 billion due to net movements in corporate, final and deferred income taxes.
Income attributable to non-controlling interests went down to P0.14 billion from P0.82 billion or by P0.68 billion or 82.54% due to lower net income. The audited income attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company for the year 2020 went down by P14.22 billion or 50.70% to P13.83 billion from the P28.06 billion net income reported in 2019.
Total comprehensive income went down by P13.22 billion from P32.54 billion to P19.32 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to the net effect of the decrease in net income, lower net unrealized gain recognized this year on FVOCI investments and the gain recognized in retirement liability. Total comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company for the year ended December 31, 2020, went down to P19.14 billion or by P12.07 billion from P31.21 billion for the same year in 2019.
Market share price was at P49.05 from P66.30 as of December 31, 2019 with a market capitalization of P220.60 billion as at December 31, 2020.

Metrobank continues to reinforce its Core Values program and maintains the principles and standards espoused in its Meaningful Banking campaign as the Bank navigates through a new operating environment under this pandemic to deliver the “You’re in Good Hands” promise to each client. This commitment underpins the Bank’s continued focus on sustaining market relevance, alongside continuous improvement in customer experience, products and services, operational efficiency and people development. Moreover, the Bank aims to deepen its commitment to instill financial discipline across new and underserved markets, and explore venues outside its current CSR activities by which it can increase its socio-economic impact.
To adapt to an evolving environment, the Bank believes that fulfilling its promises will be dependent on a sustainable culture transformation and change management program, a robust IT infrastructure, as well as sound control and risk management practices. Thus, the Bank’s investments in people are further backed by investments in IT and information security, process efficiencies, and risk and control systems.


The Bank will continue to actively improve on the Group's strong capital position. The Bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
In 2006, the Bank issued US$125.0 million Hybrid Tier 1 capital security in February and 173,618,400 common shares at P38.00 per common share in October. In May 2010, the Bank raised an additional P5.0 billion in capital through a private placement of common shares. In January 2011, the Bank raised approximately US$220.0 million through a rights offer for 200 million common shares at the offer price of P50.00 per rights share. In August 2013, the Bank increased its capital stock from P50 billion to P100 billion and on September 16, 2013, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 633,415,049 common shares (with a par value of P20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock. In April 2015, the Bank raised P32.0 billion through a rights offer for 435,371,720 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P73.50 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 7, 2015. Further, in April 2018, the Bank raised P60.0 billion through a rights offer for 799,842,250 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P75.00 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 12, 2018. In October 2019, the Bank increased its capital stock from P100 billion to P140 billion and on November 26, 2019, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 517,400,519 common shares (with a par value of P20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock, which further improved the Bank’s capital position.
The Bank also issued Tier 2 instruments to boost its capital adequacy ratio. The Bank issued Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated notes in October 2007 for P8.5 billion with a coupon of 7.0%; in October 2008 for P5.5 billion with a coupon of 7.75%; and in May 2009 for P4.5 billion with a coupon of 7.5%. With the advent of Basel III, the Bank subsequently redeemed these previously issued subordinated debt issuances as they would not have been considered as capital beginning January 1, 2014. The Bank exercised the call option on its P8.5 billion 7.0%; P5.5 billion 7.75% and P4.5 billion 7.5% Lower Tier 2 Notes on October 22, 2012, October 4, 2013 and May 6, 2014, respectively. The early redemptions of these instruments were in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes when they were originally issued. By redeeming the notes, the Bank avoided a step-up in the interest rate and the capital decay from the instruments. In 2014, the Bank raised a total of P22.5 billion in subordinated debt wherein P16.0 billion was issued on March 27, 2014 at a coupon rate of 5.375% and P6.5 billion on August 8, 2014 at 5.25%. The terms of the notes contain a loss absorption feature, allowing them to be recognized as bank capital in accordance with Basel III standards. The transactions were done in part to replace the Basel II Tier 2 notes which were redeemed on their call option dates. As approved by the BSP on April 25, 2019, on June 27, 2019, the Bank redeemed its 2024 Peso Notes amounting to P16.0 billion, ahead of its maturity. Likewise, on August 8, 2020, the Bank redeemed the 2025 Peso Notes amounting to P6.5 billion, ahead of its maturity after approval by the BSP on May 7, 2020.
As part of the Group’s capital efficiency initiatives, the Group has been active in optimizing its allied and non-allied undertakings. Among the initiatives include the sale of the Bank’s ownership in Toyota Motor Philippines Corporation in tranches between 2012 and 2013 as well as the sale of FMIC’s holdings in Global Business Power Corporation in tranches between 2013 and 2016 and FMIC’s holdings in Charter Ping An Insurance Corporation in 2014. In 2014, the Bank and PSBank also disposed of its holdings in Toyota Financial Services Philippines Corporation. Altogether, these sales further improved the Bank’s capital adequacy under Basel III. As discussed in Part I - Business item number 2 “Description of Business-Business of Registrant”, on March 13, 2019, the respective BODs of the Bank and MCC approved the proposal to merge MCC into the Bank. The proposed merger was ratified by the stockholders of the Bank on April 24, 2019, approved by the BSP on October 23, 2019, and approved by the SEC on January 3, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Group’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio are 20.15% and 19.28%, respectively, both well above the regulatory requirements.

2020 was a very challenging year for the global economy amid the triple shock brought by the COVID-19 pandemic: a health crisis, strict lockdown measures, and a global recession of unprecedented scale. The Philippines, along with most of the world’s economies, fell into recession, with the full-year 2020 GDP contraction coming in at -9.5%, a significant fall from the positive expansion of 6.0% in 2019. The sharp economic decline, especially in the second quarter of the year, was mainly attributed to the steep dive in household spending, deep slump in capital formation, and the collapse of external trade due to the impact of strict lockdown measures domestically and globally.
Full-year average inflation came in slightly higher at 2.6% compared to 2.5% in 2019 amid the faster annual increases in some commodity groups towards the end of the year. The price of food, a heavily-weighted commodity, was higher in the last quarter of the year as weather-related disturbances adversely affected domestic supply conditions. Nevertheless, the full-year average still came in within the BSP’s target range of 2-4%.
Domestic interest rates remained low throughout 2020 on ample liquidity condition, benign inflation expectations, and subsequent policy rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve and the BSP. Central banks in almost all of the countries adopted a loose monetary policy stance to support their own economies. The Fed slashed the federal funds rate to near- zero in March and has been buying about $120 billion in government-backed debt every month. Meanwhile the BSP cut key policy rates by a total of 200 basis points and deployed regulatory relief measures to complement fiscal stimulus and help stimulate the domestic economy.
Risk appetite was the key driver of the USD well into the end of 2020. Demand for the USD as a safe haven declined amid improving global market risk appetite especially for emerging market assets. The Philippine peso made strong gains and remained within the P48 level from the P50.69 close at the start of the year. The peso was even hailed as Asia’s best performing currency last year.
To overcome the adverse impact of the pandemic on the domestic economy, the government launched a socioeconomic strategy to address the Covid-19 pandemic which included fiscal and monetary measures. On the fiscal side, the National Government approved several stimulus packages aimed at helping the highly-vulnerable sectors. On the monetary side, the BSP slashed key policy rates by a total of 200 basis points and deployed regulatory relief measures to complement fiscal stimulus and help stimulate the economy.
The near-term outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain amid the renewed infection waves and new variants of the coronavirus. Nevertheless, a likely softening in the 1st half of 2021 is seen to usher in a recovery in the 2nd half as the roll-out of vaccination programs in different countries gain pace. Furthermore, the unprecedented policy support by governments is seen to continue and will become more targeted and flexible so as to adapt to fast- changing conditions.
For the Philippine economy, support will still largely come from the National Government and the BSP. A return of consumer confidence -- or the confidence of consumers to once again do both discretionary and non-discretionary spending -- will play a large role in the economic recovery because fundamentally, consumer spending is what drives the economic engines of the Philippines.

To ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the Bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. Based on this system of monitoring, the Bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2020, the contractual maturity profile shows that the Bank has at its disposal about P1.192 trillion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. This will cover 76.29% of the P1.561 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. These cash inflows exclude securities booked in FVTPL and FVOCI whose maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. Inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 101.90% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. On the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

In the normal course of the Group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. No material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.
Several suits and claims relating to the Group’s operations and labor-related cases remain unsettled. In the opinion of management, these suits and claims, if decided adversely, will not involve sums having a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.

For the year 2020, the Bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about P3.0 to P5.0 billion, of which 70% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.

Standards issued but not yet effective up to date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed in Note 2 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit 4. The listing consists of standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. Except as otherwise indicated, the Group does not expect the adoption of these new and amended PFRS and Philippine Interpretations to have significant impact on its financial statements. The Group will assess impact of these amendments on its financial position or performance when they become effective.
