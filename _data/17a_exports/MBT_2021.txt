The Group’s deposit level, sourced by the Bank, PSBank and MBCL reached P1.93 trillion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of P133.07 billion or 7.40% from P1.80 trillion as of December 31, 2020.

The decrease of P0.63 billion or 10.42% in Manager’s Checks and Demand Drafts Outstanding resulted from normal banking operations of the Bank and PSBank. Income taxes payable decreased by P0.96 billion or 35.49% due to lower tax base and new tax rate and Accrued Interest and Other Expenses went up by P0.71 billion or 7.75% due to the increase in accruals of other bank expenses. Total bonds payable decreased by P11.57 billion on account of the movements on the fixed rate bonds issued by the Parent Company - P19.0 billion additional bonds issued in June 2021 and redemption of the P11.25 billion and P10.5 billion bonds in July and September of this year, respectively; and the redemption of the P6.3 billion fixed rate bonds of PSBank in July 2021 and the P4.16 billion fixed rate bonds of ORIX METRO. Details of these bonds are discussed in Note 19 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit 4.
Non-equity Non-controlling Interest representing the portion of net income and net assets of the mutual fund subsidiaries of FMIC not attributed to the Group went up by P2.30 billion or 27.71% on account of the net increase in income of these mutual funds. Other Liabilities increased by P4.57 billion or 8.64% primarily due to the P7.83 billion increase in marginal deposits offset by the P4.76 billion decrease in bills purchased contra.
Equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company decreased by P5.70 billion or 1.76% primarily due to the P17.99 billion total cash dividends paid by the Bank, net unrealized loss on investments securities at FVOCI recognized during the year offset by the P22.16 billion net income for the year.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income went down by P20.61 billion or 19.12% mainly due to lower interest income on loans and receivables by P20.17 billion (volume related and interest rate cap on credit card) and interest income on investment securities by P0.96 billion partially offset by the P0.52 billion increase in interest income on deposit with banks and others. Meanwhile, lower interest expense on deposit liabilities by P5.82 billion and on borrowings by P3.73 billion accounted for the decrease of P9.55 billion or 44.06% in interest and finance charges. These resulted to a P11.06 billion or 12.84% decline on net interest income.
Other operating income of P25.83 billion decreased by P9.30 billion or 26.47% from P35.13 billion in 2020 on account of lower net trading and securities gain by P11.38 billion (due to last year’s disposal of investment securities at amortized cost by the Group with total carrying value of P113.5 billion as discussed in Note 8 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit 4) and the P2.46 billion decrease in foreign exchange gain offset by the increases in fee-based income by P1.71 billion, profit from assets sold by P0.37 billion and miscellaneous income by P2.33 billion.
Total operating expenses was maintained at same level with slight decrease of P0.65 billion or 1.08% from P60.12 billion to P59.47 billion with lower occupancy and equipment-related costs by P0.13 billion or 6.35% and taxes and licenses by P2.0 billion or 20.09% offset by the increases in miscellaneous expenses by P0.21 billion or 1.21% and compensation and fringe benefits by P0.38 billion or 1.52%. Total provision for credit and impairment losses of the Group amounted to P11.83 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 or P28.93 billion lower compared with P40.76 billion provision in 2020. Provision for income tax, after considering the net impact of the new tax rate under CREATE Law, was higher by P0.73 billion from P7.05 billion to P7.78 billion due to net movements in corporate, final and deferred income taxes.
Income attributable to non-controlling interests went up to P0.21 billion from P0.14 billion or by P0.07 billion or 45.45% due to higher net income of majority owned subsidiaries.
As a result, net income attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company for the year ended December 31, 2021 improved by P8.33 billion or 60.19% to P22.16 billion from the P13.83 billion net income reported in 2020.
Total comprehensive income went down by P6.62 billion from P19.32 billion to P12.70 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to the net effect of the net unrealized loss recognized this year on FVOCI investments compared with gain in previous year, mitigated by the higher net income and increase in translation adjustment and others. This caused the total comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company to decrease by P6.84 billion from P19.14 billion in 2020 to P12.30 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Market share price as of December 31, 2021 was at P55.70 (from P49.05 as of December 31, 2020) with a market capitalization of P250.51 billion.

As business activities increase, Metrobank looks forward to grow alongside the economy in support of client needs.

As the Bank pivots towards recovery, it continues to support CSR activities, recognizing its role of being an active participant in the pursuit of nation-building.
The Bank believes that the evolving operating environment calls for a robust IT infrastructure and strong control and risk management practices. Thus, the Bank’s investments in its people are supported by investments in IT and information security, process efficiencies, as well as risk and control systems.

The Bank will continue to actively improve on the Group's strong capital position. The Bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
In 2006, the Bank issued US$125.0 million Hybrid Tier 1 capital security in February and 173,618,400 common shares at P38.00 per common share in October. In May 2010, the Bank raised an additional P5.0 billion in capital through a private placement of common shares. In January 2011, the Bank raised approximately US$220.0 million through a rights offer for 200 million common shares at the offer price of P50.00 per rights share. In August 2013, the Bank increased its capital stock from P50 billion to P100 billion and on September 16, 2013, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 633,415,049 common shares (with a par value of P20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock. In April 2015, the Bank raised P32.0 billion through a rights offer for 435,371,720 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P73.50 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 7, 2015. Further, in April 2018, the Bank raised P60.0 billion through a rights offer for 799,842,250 common shares with par value of P20.00 priced at P75.00 per share. The newly issued shares were listed on the PSE on April 12, 2018. In October 2019, the Bank increased its capital stock from P100 billion to P140 billion and on November 26, 2019, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 517,401,955 common shares (with a par value of P20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock, which further improved the Bank’s capital position.
The Bank also issued Tier 2 instruments to boost its capital adequacy ratio. The Bank issued Basel II compliant Tier 2 subordinated notes in October 2007 for P8.5 billion with a coupon of 7.0%; in October 2008 for P5.5 billion with a coupon of 7.75%; and in May 2009 for P4.5 billion with a coupon of 7.5%. With the advent of Basel III, the Bank subsequently redeemed these previously issued subordinated debt issuances as they would not have been considered as capital beginning January 1, 2014. The Bank exercised the call option on its P8.5 billion 7.0%; P5.5 billion 7.75% and P4.5 billion 7.5% Lower Tier 2 Notes on October 22, 2012, October 4, 2013 and May 6, 2014, respectively. The early redemptions of these instruments were in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes when they were originally issued. By redeeming the notes, the Bank avoided a step-up in the interest rate and the capital decay from the instruments. In 2014, the Bank raised a total of P22.5 billion in subordinated debt wherein P16.0 billion was issued on March 27, 2014 at a coupon rate of 5.375% and P6.5 billion on August 8, 2014 at 5.25%. The terms of the notes contain a loss absorption feature, allowing them to be recognized as bank capital in accordance with Basel III standards. The transactions were done in part to replace the Basel II Tier 2 notes which were redeemed on their call option dates. As approved by the BSP on April 25, 2019, on June 27, 2019, the Bank redeemed its 2024 Peso Notes amounting to P16.0 billion, ahead of its maturity. Likewise, on August 8, 2020, the Bank redeemed the 2025 Peso Notes amounting to P6.5 billion, ahead of its maturity after approval by the BSP on May 7, 2020.
As part of the Group’s capital efficiency initiatives, the Group has been active in optimizing its allied and non-allied undertakings. Among the initiatives include the sale of the Bank’s ownership in Toyota Motor Philippines Corporation in tranches between 2012 and 2013 as well as the sale of FMIC’s holdings in Global Business Power Corporation in tranches between 2013 and 2016 and FMIC’s holdings in Charter Ping An Insurance Corporation in 2014. In 2014, the Bank and PSBank also disposed of its holdings in Toyota Financial Services Philippines Corporation. Altogether, these sales further improved the Bank’s capital adequacy under Basel III. As discussed in Part I - Business item number 2 “Description of Business-Business of Registrant”, on March 13, 2019, the respective BODs of the Bank and MCC approved the proposal to merge MCC into the Bank. The proposed merger was ratified by the stockholders of the Bank on April 24, 2019, approved by the BSP on October 23, 2019, and approved by the SEC on January 3, 2020.
As of December 31, 2021, the Group’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio are 20.13% and 19.28%, respectively, both well above the regulatory requirements.

2021 saw the global economy rebound from the 2020 slump as countries started to re-open and mobility restrictions were eased. The Philippines, along with most of the world’s economies, was on a sustained climb out of the recession. Second quarter growth posted the sharpest increase in a year, mostly on base effects. The positive expansion continued well into the last quarter, wherein growth was reported to be one of the highest in Asia. Compared to 2020, the economy has adapted and adjusted in terms of dealing and living with the surge and lockdown cycle.
Full-year average inflation came in higher at 4.5% compared to 2.6% in 2020 amid the faster annual increases in some commodity groups, especially food, transportation, and oil. The price of food, a heavily-weighted commodity, was persistently higher through most the year as weather-related disturbances and the African Swine Fever outbreak adversely affected domestic supply conditions. Furthermore, global commodity prices surged mid-2020 amid supply chain disruptions alongside increased global demand.
Movement of domestic interest rates were mixed on factors such as ample liquidity condition, inflation fears, and expectations of higher interest rates. Short-term rates were pinned within the 1% levels as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept policy rates steady throughout 2021. Meanwhile, tenors above 1 year inched up towards their 2019 levels amid more issuances of longer-dated debt securities, rising global bond yields, and still elevated inflation.
Surging inflation and expectations of a more hawkish Federal Reserve are the factors that supported the US dollar versus its peers. US consumer prices rose at the highest rate since 1990, while money markets are said to be pricing in a high probability of Fed rate hikes in 2022. The Philippine peso generally stayed within the P50:$1 level in the second half of last year amid tapering signals from the Fed, higher global crude oil prices, and the gradual reopening of the domestic economy. As of the last day of 2021, the domestic currency depreciated by 6% from the start of the year close.
Currently, the near-term outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain as a resurgence in Covid infections, amid the highly contagious omicron variant, is likely to disrupt economic activity. Furthermore, global growth could see a slowdown this year as more economies start exiting unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary policy support.
For the Philippine economy, while rebound back to pre-pandemic nominal GDP levels is likely to happen this year, the economy is not expected to reach full capacity just yet given the lingering risks. The threat posed by omicron and other emerging virus variants continues to loom over our heads, especially as potential super spreader events like the campaign period and national elections could exacerbate our current Covid situation.

To ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the Bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. Based on this system of monitoring, the Bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, the contractual maturity profile shows that the Bank has at its disposal about P1.046 trillion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. This will cover 63.84% of the P1.639 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. These cash inflows exclude securities booked in FVOCI whose maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. Inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 93.41% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. On the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

In the normal course of the Group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. No material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.
Several suits and claims relating to the Group’s operations and labor-related cases remain unsettled. In the opinion of management, these suits and claims, if decided adversely, will not involve sums having a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.

For the year 2022, the Bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about P3.0 to P5.0 billion, of which 70% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.

Standards issued but not yet effective up to date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed in Note 2 of the audited financial statements of the Group as presented in Exhibit 4. The listing consists of standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. Except as otherwise indicated, the Group does not expect the adoption of these new and amended PFRS and Philippine Interpretations to have significant impact on its financial statements. The Group will assess impact of these amendments on its financial position or performance when they become effective.
