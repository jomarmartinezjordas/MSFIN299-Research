Deeper participation in Power sector through the Step Acquisition of Beacon Electric. On
June 13, 2017, MPIC signed a Share Purchase Agreement with PLDT Communications and Energy Venture Inc. (PCEV) for the purchase of PCEV’s 25% remaining interest in Beacon Electric (both common and preferred shares) at a total purchase price of P=21.8 billion. This purchase consideration was settled as to P=12.0 billion in cash with the balance of P=9.8 billion to be paid over the next four (4) years. In order to fund the investment, MPIC completed an overnight placing of 4.5% of its directly held Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) shares for an aggregate consideration of ₱12.7 billion. Following this and related financing transactions, MPIC’s economic interest in MERALCO is 45.5% and in GBPC 62.4% (see Notes 4 and 10 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Entry into fast growing energy markets in Mindanao through Acquisition of Alsons Thermal Energy Corporation (ATEC). On November 27, 2017, GBPC completed the acquisition of a 50% stake in ATEC, the holding company for Alsons Consolidated Resources, Inc’s (ACR) baseload coal-fired power plant assets for a total consideration of P=4.3 billion. ATEC has stake in the following companies: (i) 75% in Sarangani Energy Corporation (SEC) which owns a 105 MW baseload coal-fired plant already in operation and another 105 MW under construction in Maasim, Sarangani Province; (ii) 100% in San Ramon Power, Inc.

The cash infusion from MPHHI will enable JDMH to upgrade its equipment and facilities, and expand its capacity (see Note 4 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Acquisition of St. Elizabeth Hospital, Inc. (SEHI). On October 5, 2017, MPHHI completed the acquisition of a 54% stake in St. Elizabeth Hospital, Inc., a 248-bed tertiary level hospital located in General Santos City. On December 8, 2017, MPHHI infused additional cash in SEHI through subscription of primary shares which increased its interest to 80%. The cash infusion from MPHHI will allow SEHI to expand and improve its facilities and purchase additional medical equipment (see Note 4 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Gearing up on Logistics business. MMI signed an agreement in January 2017 to acquire certain
assets and business of Ace Logistics, Inc. (Ace) for an aggregate purchase price of P=280 million. The acquisition was conditionally completed in April 2017. Ace is engaged in the business of logistics, including warehousing, courier express and parcel delivery, e-commerce delivery, trucking, freight forwarding, customs brokerage and domestic shipping. Ace also has a strong presence in pre-delivery inspection in the automotive industry, which MPIC intends to expand (see Note 4 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Expanding the Power Business. In March 2017, an MPIC led consortium including Covanta
Energy, LLC and Macquarie Group, Ltd. was granted Original Proponent Status by the Quezon City Government for a 42 MW energy from waste project. The project will design, construct, finance and operate an Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) facility in Quezon City. The ISWM facility will be capable of processing and converting up to 3,000 metric tons per day of Quezon City’s municipal solid waste into 42MW of renewable energy, enough to power between 60,000 to 90,000 homes (see Note 30 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Cagayan de Oro Bulk Water Supply Project. On August 14, 2017, MPW signed a joint venture agreement with the Cagayan de Oro Water District (COWD) for the formation of a joint venture company to undertake the supply of bulk treated water to address the requirements Cagayan de Oro City. The project has a term of 30 years (renewable for another 20 years subject to certain conditions), and involves the supply of up to 100 MLD of treated bulk water to COWD. Operations commenced on December 31, 2017 (see Note 30 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

NLEX Corp will remain to be an indirect subsidiary of MPIC after the implementation of the merger, which is expected to be completed by the second half of 2018 (see Note 30 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Replicating LRT-1 success to MRT3. In September 2017, MPIC was granted the original proponent
status for the rehabilitation, operations and maintenance of MRT-3. The proposal consists of the full and comprehensive rehabilitation of MRT3 and its operation and maintenance under a 30-year concession (“MRT-3 Project”). As original proponent of the MRT-3 Project, MPIC will have exclusive rights to enter negotiations with the Government in relation to the proposal. Upon successful completion of negotiations, the MRT-3 Project will be subjected to a swiss challenge consistent with the requirements of the Build-Operate-Transfer Law and its implementing rules (see Note 30 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

The Company’s accounting policies are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Company’s most recent annual consolidated financial statements, taking into account the changes in accounting policies and the adoption of the new and amended Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS), which became effective on January 1, 2017. Adoption of new standards did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Please refer to Note 37 – Significant Accounting Policies to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the BOD. The BOD monitors the operating results of each business unit separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on: consolidated net income for the year; earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or Core EBITDA; Core EBITDA margin; and Core Income. Net income for the year is measured consistent with consolidated net income in the consolidated financial statements.
Core EBITDA is measured as net income excluding depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, asset impairment on noncurrent assets, financing costs, interest income, equity in net earnings (losses) of associates and joint ventures, net foreign exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) on derivative financial instruments, provision for (benefit from) income tax and other non-recurring gains (losses). Core EBITDA margin pertains to Core EBITDA divided by service revenues.
Performance of the operating segments is also assessed based on a measure of recurring profit or core income. Core income is measured as net income attributable to owners of the Company excluding the effects of foreign exchange and derivative gains or losses and non-recurring items (NRI), net of tax effect of aforementioned. NRI represent gains or losses that, through occurrence or size, are not considered usual operating items.
The following section includes discussion of the Company’s results of its operations as presented in its consolidated financial statements as well as management’s assessments of the performance of the Group which is translated to core (or recurring) profit and non-core (or non-recurring) profit.

The Company’s revenues increased by 39% to P=65,512 million in 2017, reflecting consolidation of GBPC which contributed 21% or P=13,042 million to the group’s revenues together with improved performances from the following operating segments.

Water utilities posted a 3% increase in revenues on the strength of Maynilad’s 3% billed volume growth and a 1.9% inflationary increase in tariff effective end of April 2017.

Toll revenues are higher by 10% with average daily entries in 2017 up by 8% on the NLEX, 21% on the SCTEX and 9% on the CAVITEX compared with 2016.

Hospital revenues increased by 20% to P=10,737 million driven by (i) contributions from Marikina Valley Medical Center (acquired on July 29, 2016), JDMH (acquired on
January 31, 2017) and SEHI (acquired on October 5, 2017) and (iii) increased number of out- patients served across all hospitals.

Rail revenues grew 5% driven by the 6% growth in average daily ridership.

Also, contributing to the increase in revenues is the Logistics business owing to the
acquisition of certain logistics assets and businesses in May 2016. Logistics revenues during 2017 was P=1,144 million compared to P=469 million in 2016.

Cost of sales and services increased by 60% to P=29,374 million in 2017 due to:

GBPC’s consolidation accounting for 47% or P=8,645 million of the increase. Significant
increase in expenses included fuel costs amounting to P=5,033.0 million relating to the
consumption of coal and other fuel related costs for generation of electricity.

Maynilad’s one-time separation expenses for redundancies and redefined job functions
brought about by changes in work processes.

Logistics business grew with the expansion of trucking and warehouse services resulting in
increased personnel, maintenance and other warehouse cost.

Increased amortization expense of concession assets from completed capital expenditures at
Maynilad and MPTC.

General and administrative expenses increased by 34% to P=12,126 million in 2017 due to:
consolidation of GBPC accounting for 16% or P=1,431 million of the total increase.
increases in personnel costs with annual salary increases and expanded headcount to support
the growing logistics business.
increase in depreciation and amortization is mainly attributable to Maynilad and LRMC
driven by increased CAPEX.

Interest expense increased by 50% to P=7,995 million in 2017 due to:
Interest from acquired debt from consolidating Beacon Electric including BPHI and GBPC
beginning June 27, 2017.
Interest from loan drawdowns made during the year (see Note 18 – Long-term debt to the
2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Share in net earnings of equity method investees increased by 18% to P=8,045 million in 2017 mainly due to the increase in effective ownership in MERALCO (See Note 10 – Investment and Advances to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

In 2017 and 2016, the Parent Company’s dividend income from Beacon Electric’s preferred shares amounted to P=2,541 million and P=1,215 million, respectively (See Note 10 – Investment and Advances to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Provision for income tax increased to P=5,649 million in 2017 compared with the P=4,158 million in 2016. Consolidation of GBPC accounted for 16% or P=687 million of the total increase. In addition, 2016 provision for income tax benefitted from Maynilad’s deferred tax adjustment from adopting Optional Standard Deduction.

The 15% increase to P=13,151 million in the consolidated net income attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company was mainly attributable to (i) an expanded power portfolio through increased investment in Beacon Electric; (ii) robust traffic growth on each of the roads held by MPTC; and (iii) continuing growth in the Hospital Group.

The Company recognized a net other comprehensive loss of P=466 million in 2017 as compared with the net comprehensive income of P=1,468 million in 2016. Year 2017 includes higher share in actuarial valuation adjustment from MERALCO and Maynilad and cumulative translation adjustments from DMT, CII B&R, PT Nusantara and MERALCO.

MPIC’s share in the consolidated core income increased by 17% from P=12,106 million in 2016 to P=14,104 million in 2017 primarily reflecting the following:
Power (distribution and generation) accounted for P=9.4 billion or 52% of the aggregate contribution;
Toll operations contributed P=3.9 billion or 22% of the total;
Water (distribution, production and sewerage treatment) contributed P=3.7 billion or 21% of
the total;
Hospital group contributed P=685 million or 4% of the total; and,
the Rail, Logistics and others contributed P=150 million or 1% of the total.
The figures referred to above represent MPIC’s share in the stand-alone core income of the operating companies, net of consolidation adjustments.

Non-recurring expenses amounted to P=953 million in 2017 and comprised of (a) accounting loss on remeasurement of previously held interest in Beacon Electric, (b) provision for impairment of goodwill in MMI, (c) provision for impairment in investment in AFPI, (d) refinancing costs,
(e) project expenses and (f) one-time separation expense as a result of Maynilad’s redundancy and right-sizing program, offset by (a) an accounting gain from remeasurement of previously held interest in TMC and ESC and (b) a gain on sale of MERALCO shares. Non-recurring income in 2016 amounted to
P=650 million and mainly included Maynilad’s remeasurement of future deferred taxes.

MPIC’s power business contributed P=9.4 billion to Core Net Income in 2017, an increase of 30% driven by step-up investments in MERALCO and GBPC.
MPIC is continuing its development of power-related services and investments in the Philippines with its combination of distribution, generation and retail electricity sales across Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao.
In March 2017, an MPIC led consortium was granted Original Proponent Status by the Quezon City Government for a 42 MW energy-from-waste project. The project is expected to be subjected to competitive challenge within the year. MPIC is also talking with other local government units to develop similar projects (see Note 30 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).
In June 2017, MPIC deepened its participation in the Philippine power sector as it acquired the remaining 25% ownership in Beacon Electric at an aggregate purchase price of P=21.8 billion. Following this and related transactions, MPIC’s economic interest in MERALCO is 45.5% and in Global Power 62.4% as at December 31, 2017 (see Note 10 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).
In November 2017, Global Power completed its acquisition of a 50% stake in ATEC, the holding company for Alsons Consolidated Resources, Inc.’s baseload coal-fired power plant assets in Mindanao.

MPIC is committed to providing reliable and economic power generation throughout the Philippines. Coal, even with the clean coal technologies we are committed to, may not be popular with certain segments of society but remains for the time being the most efficient way to supply the essential base load to provide stable power to homes and businesses throughout the country. MPIC is also committed to seeking increased investment in renewable energy compatible with the demand profile of the Philippines.

MERALCO’s Core Net Income for 2017 rose 3% to P=20.2 billion. Distribution
line with volume growth on flat tariffs which combined with an improved result from associated companies to increase Core Income for the period.
The 5% increase in energy sales was noted across all customer classes. Residential growth was driven by the increasing number of condominiums, apartments and government housing. The commercial sector grew on continued expansion of the Business Process Outsourcing and Gaming sectors while the Industrial sector was anchored on the robust performance of the semiconductor, food & beverage, and basic metal industries.
MERALCO spent P=12.1 billion on capital expenditures in 2017 to address critical loading of existing facilities and to support growth in demand and customer connections.
The status of MERALCO’s key power projects, several of which remain with the ERC for Power Supply Agreement (“PSA”) approval, through MERALCO PowerGen Corporation (MGen), is as follows:
San Buenaventura Power Limited, a joint venture between MGen and Thailand’s New Growth B.V., a subsidiary of EGCO, is developing a 455 MW (net) supercritical coal-fired power plant in Mauban, Quezon. Construction is proceeding as scheduled, with commercial operation due in June 2019. The plant capacity is contracted under an ERC approved PSA with MERALCO.
Atimonan One Energy Corporation is awaiting ERC review and approval of its PSA for it to issue a Notice to Proceed for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction for its 2x600 MW coal-fired plant in Atimonan, Quezon. The PSA for the entire capacity is contracted by MERALCO.

Revenues in 2017 amounted to P=282.6 billion, 10% higher than the P=257.2 billion in 2016. The higher revenues are the result of the combined effect of (i) a 5% increase in volume of energy sold; (ii) the increased generation charge related to the 20-day maintenance shutdown of the Malampaya gas facilities and the extended maintenance outages of certain coalfired power plants; (iii) increased price of coal, oil and gas; and (iv) the depreciation of the peso versus the U.S. dollar.

Purchased power cost, the biggest component of MERALCO’s expenses, is the cost of electricity supply. MERALCO does not operate its own generation capacity in the Philippines at present and purchases all of the power it distributes from the National Power Corporation (NPC) and its Successor Generating Companies, the WESM and Independent Power Producers.

MERALCO’s net income increased by 6% to P=20.4 billion in 2017 from P=19.2 billion in 2016. This is mainly driven by increased power of volume sold and lower losses at FPM Power.

GBPC sold 4,465 GWH in 2017, an increase of 22% from a year earlier. Core Net Income for 2017 rose 1% to P=2.9 billion.
Global Power’s subsidiary, PEDC, began operation of its 150 MW expansion plant (PEDC3) in the first quarter of 2017. Rectification works are close to completion with the final plant acceptance expected within the first quarter of 2018.
In November 2017, GBPC completed the acquisition of a 50% less one share stake in ATEC. The partnership with Alsons is an opportunity for GBPC to accelerate its entry into fast growing energy markets in Mindanao. With the planned interconnection between the Visayas and Mindanao grids, the partnership will greatly benefit power consumers as we work towards maximizing use of energy resources and optimizing power supply.
GBPC is looking at several projects to expand its energy portfolio through investment in solar, bagasse, pumped storage, hydro and run of river energy sources as part of the company’s commitment to offer flexible energy solutions to its customers.

Revenues in 2017 amounted to P=23.8 billion, 35% higher than the P=17.6 billion in 2016 driven by the increased electricity sold and contributions from PEDC3 which declared commercial operation in January 26, 2017.

The combined increase in purchased power and coal fuel consumption amounting to P=4.3 billion contributed to the significant increase in expenses. The increase in coal and fuel consumption was a result of the start of PEDC3’s commercial operations in January 2017.

GBPC’s net income growth slowed down to 6% from the 35% revenue growth due to higher income tax driven by the end of income tax holidays for CEDC and PEDC.

MPTC recorded Core Net Income of P=3.9 billion in 2017, a 20% increase from the P=3.3 billion recorded a year earlier. System-wide vehicle entries increased by 64% to an average of 903,525 a day due mainly to the investment in PT Nusantara in Indonesia.

Average daily vehicle entries for all three of our domestic tollways system (NLEX, CAVITEX and SCTEX) rose 10% to 445,350 compared with 405,576 in 2016.
Traffic on the NLEX grew 8% and surged by 21% on the SCTEX following integration of these two roads in 2016. Traffic on the CAVITEX rose 9% driven by growth in residential communities in Cavite and tourism in Batangas.
For all our built roads, we are focused on investment to meet rising demand:
An additional 64 kilometers of lane widening was added to the NLEX together with further
toll plaza expansions;
Completed rehabilitation of the entire SCTEX pavement from Tipo to Tarlac and
modernization of the SCTEX and CAVITEX Traffic Control Room; and
Diversified electronic payment options enabling motorists to pay tollway fees using Easy
Trip RFID, beep cards, and Mastercard and Smart Mastercard.
Progress on new projects is as follows:
NLEX Harbour Link (P=10.5 billion, 5.8 km) to Caloocan City will be completed this year.
Direct travel between the Ports of Manila and the NLEX will then be reduced to only 10
minutes.
NLEX Harbour Link Radial Road 10 (P=6.0 billion, 2.6km) broke ground in August 2017 and
construction is expected to start in the first half of 2018 with completion in 2019.
CAVITEX C5 South Link Expressway (P=12.6 billion, 7.7km) joining C-5 Road Taguig to
R-1 (Coastal) is in full construction with completion due in 2020.
Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway (P=26.3 billion, 8.3km) contract award was made in
November 2017 with completion due in 2021.
Cavite Laguna Expressway (P=16.9 billion, 44.6km) construction of the Laguna section
commenced in the second half of 2017, a portion of which will be completed by the first quarter of 2019. The groundbreaking of the Cavite section is expected by the second quarter of 2018 with completion by 2020.
NLEX-SLEX Connector Road (P=23.3 billion, 8.0km elevated) is due to begin in the third quarter of 2018 and complete in 2020.
MPTC will spend approximately P=122.8 billion in the next five years on building highways and tollroads around the Philippines. The amount of investment is an estimate that assumes the satisfactory resolution of various overdue tariff adjustments, now ranging between 20% and 48% on different parts of the network.

DMT in Bangkok reported a 2% increase in daily traffic to 97,919 while CII B&R in Vietnam delivered an 8% increase to 52,788 in 2017.
On November 3, 2017, MPTC acquired 48.3% of PT Nusantara, a publicly listed limited liability company in Indonesia. PT Nusantara’s infrastructure portfolio generates approximately 80% of its Core Net Income from Tollroads operations, which attract over 300,000 vehicle entries a day.
MPIC’s presence now in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia means we are well on the way to establishing a PAN-ASEAN Tollways group.

Net toll revenues amounted to P=13,107 million, 10% higher year-on-year, mainly due to strong traffic growth on the NLEX (8%), SCTEX (21%) and CAVITEX (9%).

Costs and expenses remained flat at P=6.2 billion in 2017 and 2016. The inflationary increase in personnel cost and increase in depreciation and amortization was offset by the decrease in O&M fees from P=2,146 million in 2016 to P=568 million in 2017 owing to the consolidation of TMC beginning April 2017 (see Notes 4 and 19 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

Core income increased by 20% to P=3,935 million due to the combination of traffic growth on NLEX, SCTEX and CAVITEX and transfer of the investment in DMT from MPIC to MPTC. DMT was transferred from MPIC to MPTC in September 2016. Note, however, that such transfer of the DMT investment would not have any material impact on the consolidated results of MPIC.

Non-recurring income included accounting gains on remeasurement of previously held interest in TMC and ESC amounting to P=1.8 billion and P=198 million, respectively, at MPTC level (see Note 4 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements) offset by the refinancing cost and project expenses.

Reported Net Income grew significantly more than growth in Core Income with MPTC recognizing a remeasurement gain on previously held interest in TMC as discussed above.

MPIC’s water business comprises its investments in Maynilad, the biggest water utility in the Philippines, and MPW, the Company’s unit focused on business development outside Metro Manila. The water segment’s contribution to Core Net Income amounted to P=3.7 billion in 2017, most of it attributable to Maynilad.

Despite Maynilad’s excellent record of service delivery, the matter of Maynilad’s tariffs for the entire 2013-2017 five-year Business Plan period, together with the two related arbitration awards in its favor, remain unresolved. In summary:
In 2015, Maynilad received an arbitration award in its favor against the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), which centered on treatment of Corporate Income Tax as an expense to be recovered through the tariff.
MWSS did not act on this award and so Maynilad, in accordance with its concession agreement, sought to be kept whole by the Republic of the Philippines (RoP). RoP refused to act on this so Maynilad, with reluctance, launched an arbitration claim in Singapore seeking full recovery of forgone revenues. On July 24, 2017, Maynilad was notified that all three members of the arbitration panel voted unanimously to uphold its claim.
On February 9, 2018, the RoP unexpectedly applied to the High Court in Singapore seeking to have the award in Maynilad’s favor vacated. Furthermore, the RoP is seeking to have the hearings in secret rather than in open court.
Maynilad is in constructive and collaborative dialogue with a newly revitalized MWSS regarding the 2018-2022 five-year Business Plan. However, it appears that the matter of the Corporate Income Tax recoverability through the tariff and the now sizeable cash claim on the RoP will take further time to resolve. While Maynilad strives to meet its service obligations, the ongoing refusal of MWSS and RoP to address either the tariff matter or the revenue claim is hampering financing of the required capital expenditures.
Non-Revenue Water (NRW) measured at the District Metered Area level increased to 31.7% as at the end of 2017 from 30.6% in 2016 due to abnormal water production in connection with last year’s El Niño phenomenon while total NRW is now down to 39%. Just eleven years ago, when MPIC first invested in Maynilad, NRW was at a staggering 68% and millions of customers had inadequate access to water.
Maynilad repaired 26,792 pipe leaks across its concession area in 2017 and installed 38 kilometers of water pipes, expanding its distribution line to 7,675 kilometers. At the end of the year, drinking water supply and sewerage coverage were 93% and 15% of its population, respectively, while 24- hour service and average water pressure of over 7 psi were maintained at 100%.
Capital expenditure for 2017 stood at P=12.0 billion, much of it directed to upgrading and building reservoirs and pumping stations, laying primary pipelines and construction of wastewater facilities to improve public health. Maynilad is currently building six new sewage treatment plants. Once completed, these new wastewater facilities will be able to serve approximately 1,340,000 Maynilad customers.

Revenues in 2017 rose 3% to P=20,774 million from P=20,224 million in 2016. Volume sold during this period grew 3% to 511.7 million cubic meters as compared with last year while the number of water connections (or billed customers) rose 4% to 1,358,758 at the end of 2017.

Costs and expenses grew by 11% from P=8,285 million to P=9,166 million primarily driven by increases in personnel expense as a result of Maynilad’s Special Opportunity Program (SOP) – a “right sizing” program to optimize headcount, higher amortization of intangible assets which grew in line with Maynilad’s continuing capital expenditure program. In addition, light and power increased due primarily to higher average power rates, coupled with higher electrical usage as a result of increased operating hours of pumping stations and in-line boosters to improve service levels in the South, increased water treatment activities in Putatan treatment plant to address water quality issues, and more sewage treatment plants in operation.

Core Net Income for 2017 increased 3% to P=7,379 million from P=7,171 million due to tight control of operating expenses.

Non-recurring expense in 2017 substantially comprises SOP costing P=275 million which was recorded in March 2017 and deferred tax adjustment on accrued expenses.

The increase in Reported Net Income by 2% is higher than the increase in Core Income of 3% owing to the recognition of the SOP expense as mentioned above.

Outside the Maynilad concession, MPW is delivering on its water project development program.

In Metro Iloilo, together with partners, we now have a bulk water supply project (170 million liters per day or MLD when complete) as well as a concession for water distribution and the provision of wastewater services currently serving 38,000 connections across Iloilo City and nearby municipalities.

LRMC has operated the LRT Line 1 (LRT-1), since September 12, 2015. LRMC has improved efficiencies resulting in increased number of trains and trips, reduced passenger waiting time, improved safety and cleanliness of the stations, increased ridership, extended operating hours and increased customer satisfaction all while achieving ISO certifications for quality management and environmental management.
As at the end of 2017, LRMC has successfully restored 32 Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs), bringing the total available to 109 LRVs and reducing passengers waiting time to 3.4 minutes from more than five minutes when LRMC took over.

Further improvements in the overall riding experience are expected as the company is on track with its overall rehabilitation plan for the LRT-1 existing line:
By the second quarter of 2018, LRMC should be ready to run its trains at 60 kph (currently at 40 kph) so shortening travel and waiting time and adding more trips per day.
The Company is also on track with its ₱750-million Station Improvement Project. LRMC has already completed stations Doroteo Jose, UN, Gil Puyat, Abad Santos, Pedro Gil and R Papa. Remaining stations will be completed by the fourth quarter of 2018.

Significant increase in the liabilities and equity accounts substantially resulted from the consolidation of Beacon Electric (including GBPC; see Note 4 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements). Other factors contributing to the increase are discussed below:

Service concession fees payable – current and noncurrent portions – (Increase) Represents movement in foreign exchange and accretion net of actual payment of concession fees (see Note 17 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).
Long-term debt – current and noncurrent portions – (Increase) Aside from loans resulting from consolidating Beacon Electric, BPHI and GBPC, additional loan drawdowns were also made during 2017 (see Notes 4 and 18 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).
Equity reserves – (Decrease) Mainly due to the premium on acquisition of non-controlling interest (see Note 4 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).
Retained earnings – (Increase) Attributable to the net income earned for the period, net of dividends declared in March 2017 and in August 2017 (see Note 20 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).
Non-controlling interest (NCI) – (Increase) Aside from the consolidation of GBPC which is effectively owned by MPIC at 56%, the acquisition of majority interest in entities TMC, ESC, DCI and SEHI also contributed to the increase (see Note 4 to the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).
