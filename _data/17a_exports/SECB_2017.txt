The Bank’s liquidity is adequate with a liquid-assets-to-total-assets ratio of 49.45% in 2017, 56.62% in 2016, and 53.51% in 2015. Liquid assets consist of cash and other cash items, due from BSP, due from other banks, interbank loans receivable, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and investment securities at amortized cost. Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet funding obligations such as the repayment of liabilities or payment of asset purchases. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed using the Maximum Cumulative Outflows (MCO) and funding diversification/ concentration limits. A Contingency Funding Plan is likewise in place to ensure readiness for every liquidity crisis situation. The Bank’s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) is directly responsible for liquidity risk exposures. ALCO regularly monitors the Bank’s positions and sets the appropriate fund transfer prices to effectively manage movement of funds across business activities. The Bank does not anticipate any cash flow or liquidity problems within the next twelve months, and is not in default or breach of any note, loan, lease or other indebtedness or financing arrangement requiring it to make payments. All payables have been paid by the Bank within the stated terms. There are no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Bank’s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.
Events that will trigger direct or contingent financial obligation that is material to the company, including any default or acceleration of an obligation
There were no events that will trigger direct or contingent financial obligation that is material to the company, including any default or acceleration of an obligation.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions, Arrangements, Contingent Obligations and Other relationships of the company with unconsolidated entities or other persons
The Bank has outstanding commitments, contingent liabilities, bank guarantees and tax assessments that arose from the normal course of operations. The Bank does not anticipate losses that will materially affect its financial position and results of operations as a result of these transactions.

The Bank’s commitments for capital expenditures will be funded out of cash flows from operations. This covers investments in electronic systems to comply with regulatory requirements (e.g. electronic money laundering monitoring system), investments in other systems (e.g. credit evaluation system), upgrades of existing systems (e.g. telecommunications system), expansion of the Bank’s electronic banking channels, ATM installations, renovation or relocation or branch premises, and investments for new branches.

In the normal course of operations, the Bank’s activities are affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes. The Bank follows a prudent policy on managing its assets and liabilities so as to ensure that exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates are kept within acceptable limits and within regulatory guidelines.

There are no significant elements of income or loss that did not arise from continuing operations of the Bank.

The Bank’s financial position or results of operations are not affected by seasonal aspects.

The Philippine economy is expected to exhibit robust expansion this year, with our forecast for GDP growth to nudge higher to 6.8% from last year’s 6.7%. Strong domestic and external demand as well as solid production will fuel this year’s growth, which is seen to be one of the fastest in the Asian region. We expect the domestic economy to be reinforced by government’s tax reforms and infrastructure program.
