The Bank’s liquidity is adequate with a liquid-assets-to-total-assets ratio of 43.83% in 2018, 44.88% in 2017 and 53.05% in 2016. Liquid assets consist of cash and other cash items, due from BSP, due from other banks, interbank loans receivable, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and investment securities at amortized cost. Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet funding obligations such as the repayment of liabilities or payment of asset purchases. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed using the Maximum Cumulative Outflows (MCO) and funding diversification/ concentration limits. A Contingency Funding Plan is likewise in place to ensure readiness for every liquidity crisis situation. The Bank’s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) is directly responsible for liquidity risk exposures. ALCO regularly monitors the Bank’s positions and sets the appropriate fund transfer prices to effectively manage movement of funds across business activities. The Bank does not anticipate any cash flow or liquidity problems within the next twelve months, and is not in default or breach of any note, loan, lease or other indebtedness or financing arrangement requiring it to make payments. All payables have been paid by the Bank within the stated terms.

The Philippine economy is again in a growth trajectory, with our 2019 forecast for GDP growth at 6.4% from last year's 6.2%. Despite the slowdown in 2018, the economy still retained its label as one of the fastest growing in the Asian region, and we expect it to remain that way. Apart from the country's strong macroeconomic fundamentals and inflation easing this year, factors that will push economic growth are improved domestic and external demand, bigger infrastructure spending, higher tourism arrivals, and solid policy reforms.
