Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Bank will not be able to meet its obligations when they become due. It may be classified into two sub-types:
1. Funding Liquidity Risk, the risk that a firm cannot obtain the necessary funds to meet its obligations as they fall due. It stems from the mismatch of asset, liability, exchange contract and contingent commitment maturities.
2. Trading Liquidity Risk, the risk that an entity will be unable to unwind a position in a particular instrument at or near its market value because of lack of depth or disruption in the market for that instrument.
With liquidity being the lifeline of banks, the risk is mainly monitored through tools such as liquidity gap reports including the Maximum Cumulative Outflow (MCO) status, liquidity ratios and assessment of deposit concentration. This is further augmented by periodic liquidity stress testing. Regular reports are then provided to Senior Management, the ALCO and the ROC regarding these tools. Moreover, the Bank has established Contingency Funding Plans to deal with potential liquidity crisis situations.
RMG assists the ALCO by providing the relevant information with respect to the management of all risks related to the Group’s assets and liabilities, and the trading and accrual books. The impact of the Group’s activities on capital is also monitored by the ALCO with the RMG providing the necessary data to the Committee for assessment. Results of their analysis are reported on a periodic basis to the ROC. Through the ALCO, RMG provides an independent assessment of the depth and magnitude of funding liquidity risk that the Bank takes and suggests ways that can be explored to enhance the Bank’s liquidity risk profile or keep exposure within risk appetite. RMG also provides its views on proposals or strategies concerning balance sheet structure, funding mix or concentration, and bond or note issuance.

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions, Arrangements, Contingent Obligations and Other relationships of the company with unconsolidated entities or other persons
The Bank has outstanding commitments, contingent liabilities, bank guarantees and tax assessments that arose from the normal course of operations. The Bank does not anticipate losses that will materially affect its financial position and results of operations as a result of these transactions.


The Bank’s commitments for capital expenditures will be funded out of cash flows from operations. This covers investments in electronic systems to comply with regulatory requirements (e.g. electronic money laundering monitoring system), investments in other systems (e.g. core banking, finance and accounting systems, credit evaluation system), upgrades of existing systems (e.g. telecommunications system), expansion of the Bank’s electronic banking channels, ATM installations, renovation or relocation or branch premises, and investments for new branches.

In the normal course of operations, the Bank’s activities are affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes. The Bank follows a prudent policy on managing its assets and liabilities so as to ensure that exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates are kept within acceptable limits and within regulatory guidelines.


On October 20, 2020, after obtaining regulatory approvals in the Philippines and in Thailand, the Bank completed the sale of the 7,075,000 SBFCI shares to Krungsri. The Bank recorded a gain amounting to P=933.1 million.

There are no significant elements of income or loss that did not arise from continuing operations of the Bank.


The Bank’s financial position or results of operations are not affected by seasonal aspects.

The recession in 2020 caused the country’s GDP to fall 9.5% year-on-year. Our 2021 GDP growth forecast of 7.1% so far hinges on the ongoing accommodative monetary policy and prudent fiscal support, further easing of community quarantine measures coupled with enforcement of health and safety protocols and improving business and consumer confidence on the back of vaccine availability and distribution by 2H21. Various factors may impact the economic outlook both favorably or negatively.
