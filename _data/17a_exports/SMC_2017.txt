The Group’s consolidated sales revenue for the year 2017 amounted to P826,086 million, 21% higher than 2016, on the back of robust, double-digit growth across its fuels and petrochemicals, infrastructure, and beer, liquor, and packaging businesses.
The higher cost of sales resulted from the increase in crude prices of Petron Corporation (Petron), increase in sales volume of Petron and San Miguel Brewery Inc. (SMB), higher excise tax of SMB domestic operations, and the higher coal prices and energy fees of SMC Global Power Holdings Corp. (SMC Global).
Sustained sales growth, coupled with effective fixed cost management, brought consolidated operating income to P111,042 million, 11% higher than last year.
The increase in equity in net earnings in 2017 primarily represents the share of SMC Global on the net income of Angat Hydropower Corporation (Angat Hydro) vs net loss in 2016 offset by the decrease in net income of Northern Cement Corporation (NCC).
The gain on sale of investments and property and equipment in 2017 pertains to the sale of service stations by Petron Malaysia to the Malaysian government. Certain service stations of Petron Malaysia were closed to give way to the Mass Rail Transit project of Malaysia.
The decrease in other charges was primarily due to the recognition of lower foreign exchange loss on the translation of the United States (US) Dollar denominated long-term debt of the Parent Company, Petron, and SMC Global, and finance lease liabilities of SMC Global, partly offset by the lower gain on foreign exchange from foreign currency denominated cash and cash equivalents of the Parent Company.
Income from continuing operations amounted to P54,814 million, 36% higher compared to 2016.
Consolidated recurring net income, excluding the effect of forex translation and one-time gain from the sale of the telecommunications business last year, was up 11% to P54,654 million, compared to the previous year’s P49,350 million.
Share of non-controlling interests in the Group’s net income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 mainly due to the higher net income of Petron and SMB.
Consolidated volume of SMB reached almost 260 million cases, surpassing last year’s volume by 13%. Strong volume growth was driven mainly by favorable economic conditions, along with effective marketing campaigns and integrated sales initiatives. Consolidated revenues rose 17% to P113,255 million.
Strong domestic operations, coupled with the contributions of international operations, pushed operating income up 15% to P31,161 million, while net income rose 17% to P20,711 million.
With favorable economic conditions, domestic beer volumes rose 15%, boosted by strong marketing campaigns and integrated sales initiatives. Revenues grew 18% to P99,999 million, partly reflecting a price increase implemented on October 1, 2017, as a result of the increase in excise tax. This significant improvement in volumes partly made up for the impact of higher excise taxes and operating costs and resulted to a 14% improvement in operating income to P30,139 million.
Red Horse Extra Strong Beer and San Miguel Pale Pilsen remained the top selling brands, with San Mig Light, Gold Eagle Beer, and San Miguel Flavored Beer turning in strong contributions as well.
SMB implemented new marketing campaigns and consumer and trade programs to sustain volume growth, strengthen brand equity, and increase consumption. New digital video campaigns featuring actress Ina Raymundo and rapper Curtsmith, as well as the “MBC Bagong Taon, Bagong Milyon” crown collection promo, strengthened Pale Pilsen’s position. Meanwhile, Red Horse’s “Pambansang Muziklaban” and “Pasiklaban” events continued to enable the brand to assert its position as “The No. 1 beer”. San Mig Light also continued to push its “Mahaba-habang inuman” campaign through a new television commercial dubbed “5 Signs”, while San Miguel Flavoured Beer utilized digital and social media advertising to boost penetration of the ‘millennial’ market.

San Miguel Brewing International Limited’s (SMBIL) operating income in 2017 grew 18% to US$24 million. SMBIL continued to intensify efforts to sustain profit growth and accelerate the growth of San Miguel Brands, including Red Horse. San Miguel brands grew 6% versus last year on the back of strong results from South and North China, Thailand, Vietnam and the Exports markets. However, due to lower sales from some local brands in Indonesia and North China, overall volume declined 2%. Revenues ended at US$263 million, at par with last year.
SMBIL continues to implement volume expansion initiatives for San Miguel brands by increasing trade coverage as well as pursuing cost reduction and efficiency improvements.

For the fourth consecutive year, Ginebra San Miguel Inc. (GSMI) registered continued growth. Sales volumes rose 10% to 27.7 million cases, on the back of effective campaigns and below-the-line promotions, which led to higher consumption of flagship brand Ginebra San Miguel and Vino Kulafu. Both brands posted double digit growth. Consumers’ strong affinity to the Barangay Ginebra Gin Kings basketball team was a key contributor to growth, as was Vino Kulafu’s 60th year anniversary, which was hyped all-year-round via radio commercials anchored on its “Dosenang Lakas” proposition.
Expansion of consumer market reach, particularly the millennial generation, also contributed to strong volumes. Based on the Nielsen Retail Audit as of December 2017, market share is now at 32%.
Revenues rose 12% to P20,892 million, the result of higher volumes and price increase implemented last April 1, 2017. Operating income reached P1,397 million, 43% higher than the previous year while net income significantly rose 67% to P602 million.

San Miguel Pure Foods Company Inc. (SMPFC) posted consolidated revenues of P117,449 million, 5% higher than 2016, on the sustained strong performance of the Poultry & Fresh Meats and Processed Meats businesses.
Operating Income rose 11% to P9,926 million, the result of favorable selling prices for poultry, fresh and processed meats products; a better sales mix, and lower costs of some major raw materials.
Net income ended 16% higher at P6,906 million.

The Poultry & Meats and Feeds businesses ended 2017 with revenues reaching P80,803 million, up 6% from 2016. This mainly was the result of better sales mix, favorable selling prices of chicken and fresh Meats products and aggressive marketing and promotion activities for feeds.

Milling business revenues declined by 3% to P9,506 million due to flat volumes and continued price pressures, including stiff competition and lower global wheat prices. Nevertheless, the Milling business remained profitable despite the margin squeeze.

SMPFC’s Branded Value-Added Business benefitted from the continued growth of its core products. The robust performance of processed meats, coupled with new product launches and intensified brand-building efforts, resulted to revenues of P29,405 million, 6% higher than 2016.
In a bid to further strengthen market leadership, a number of new products were introduced. Among these products are Purefoods Pulled Pork, Purefoods flavored luncheon meat (Cheese and Bacon); La Pacita Graham Cracker sandwiches and Oat Cookies, dual-flavored popsies and Avocado classic ice cream made with carabao milk.
SMPFC grew its value-added products and launched new offerings under the easy-to- cook and easy-to heat lines. These include pre-marinated chicken cut-ups in three flavors (ginger, gata and tomato) and fully cooked lechon kawali and crispy pata.
SMPFC also started implementing its capacity expansion program in 2017. This includes the construction of five feed mills and at least one flour mill; a new hotdog plant, and the first ready-to-eat manufacturing plant, located in Santa Rosa Laguna, which will serve the growing consumer demand for convenient and nutritious meals. Construction of these facilities is progressing according to schedule.


In 2017, the San Miguel Packaging Group continued to work to broaden its market presence in the region, posting very encouraging growth in Australia.

With continuous implementation of cost management efforts and programs to increase productivity, operating income grew 16% to P2,994 million.

SMC Global’s consolidated revenues for year 2017 grew 6% to P82,791 million, the result of higher realization prices from both bilateral and spot sales. Consolidated off-take volume however ended slightly lower at 17,227 gigawatt hours (Gwh) due to lower bilateral volumes from Ilijan and San Roque power plants. Ilijan Power Plant’s Block 1 underwent an annual maintenance shutdown as did the Malampaya gas facility, from January 28 to February 16. Block 2 experienced a temporary shutdown due to series of earthquakes that hit Batangas at the beginning of the year. Sual Power Plant’s Unit 2 likewise experienced a shutdown from June 14 to November 10, due to a main generator transformer failure. San Roque power plant also recorded lower power dispatch due to lower water level.
Operating income ended 9% lower than the previous year at P24,276 million, the result of higher energy fees, coal consumption costs; higher natural gas prices; replacement power purchases, lower bilateral volumes from Ilijan, and the sale of the Limay Cogen plant in 2016.

Net income amounted to P8,217 million, significantly higher than 2016 due to lower unrealized forex losses.
In 2017, SMC Global’s total generating capacity reached 3,213 megawatts (MW), with the addition of 450 MW from the Malita and Limay power plants, which finally started commercial operation.

Petron reported a net income of P14,087 million, 30% higher than last year’s P10,822 million as a result of its continued focus on high-value segments and strong sales volumes from both Philippine and Malaysian operations.
Consolidated volumes reached 107.8 million barrels, up 2% from 105.7 million barrels in the previous year. Sales in the retail segment grew 8%, on the back of the continued aggressive expansion of its service station network. By the end of the year, Petron breached the 3,000-service station mark. Sales of high-margin products such as gasoline, Jet A-1 and lubricants grew double digits while Petrochemicals provided good margins and additional revenue as volumes grew by 9%.
Petron’s consolidated revenues reached P434,624 million, a 26% improvement from the P343,840 million recorded in 2016. Operating income grew 16% to P27,638 million. This would have been much higher if not for the scheduled maintenance turnarounds at both the 180,000 barrel-per-day Bataan refinery and the 88,000 barrel-per-day Port Dickson refinery in Malaysia.

Petron’s domestic performance was driven by higher sales of high-margin products such as gasoline, Jet A-1, and lubricants. Earlier in the year, Petron launched the first and only Euro 6 fuel, Blaze 100 Euro 6, considered the best gasoline in the country. Sales of lubricants such as Blaze Racing also contributed to overall growth. These new products, together with better efficiencies and higher production capability at the upgraded Petron Bataan refinery, all helped boost Philippine operations for the year.

The performance of Petron’s Malaysia operations was also remarkable, driven by strong volume growth which resulted to increased market share. Petron Malaysia also continues to pursue its retail outlet expansion program.

SMC Infrastructure posted consolidated revenues of P22,497 million for 2017, a 13% increase from the previous year. Growth is attributed to higher vehicular volume at all operating toll roads namely the: South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), Skyway 1 and 2, Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR), Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Toll Expressway (TPLEX), and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Expressway (NAIAx).

On March 9, 2018, the BOD of SMC Global approved the issuance of Redeemable Perpetual Securities (RPS) amounting to US$650 million in favor of the Parent Company, to be used to partially finance the acquisition of the Masinloc power assets.

On March 15, 2018, the BOD of the Parent Company approved the subscription to the US$650 million RPS to be issued by SMC Global.
On March 15, 2018, the Parent Company subscribed to the US$650 million RPS. Proceeds from the RPS will be used by SMC Global to partially finance its acquisition of the Masinloc power plant.

On December 17, 2017, SMC Global executed a Share Purchase Agreement with AES Phil Investment Pte. Ltd. (AES Phil) and Gen Plus B. V. (Gen Plus) for the purchase by SMC Global of (a) 51% and 49% equity interests of AES Phil and Gen Plus, respectively, in Masin-AES Pte. Ltd. (the “Target Company”); (b) 100% equity interest of The AES Corporation in AES Transpower Private Ltd. (ATPL); and (c) 100% equity interest of AES Phil in AES Philippines Inc. (API), (collectively, “the Transaction”).
The Target Company, through its subsidiaries [including Masinloc Power Partners Co. Ltd. (MPPCL)], owns and/or operates (i) the 2 x 315 MW coal-fired power plant; (ii) the under construction project expansion of the 335 MW unit known as Unit 3; (iii) the 10 MW battery energy storage project, all located in the Province of Zambales, Philippines; and (iv) the 2 x 20 MW battery energy storage facility in Kabankalan, Negros Occidental, which is still at the pre-development stage. ATPL has a Philippine Regional Office and Headquarters which provides the corporate support services to MPPCL, while API provides energy marketing services to MPPCL.
With the acquisition by SMC Global of the Target Company, ATPL and API, SMC Global aims to improve its existing baseload capacity to further ensure its ability to provide affordable and reliable supply of power to its customers. The additional power assets provide an opportunity for SMC Global to increase its footprint in clean coal technology that provides reliable and affordable power, particularly in Luzon. The Transaction will result in the production of electricity in an environmentally responsible way.
The total consideration for the Transaction is US$1,900 million, subject to a post-closing purchase price adjustment. The total consideration will be paid in cash by SMC Global to be funded through a combination of its (a) availment of US dollar-denominated long-term borrowings from various financial institutions totaling to US$1,200 million and (b) issuing RPS to, and obtaining advances from, SMC amounting to US$650 million and US$150 million, respectively.
On February 23, 2018, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) issued its decision which states that the Transaction does not result in a substantial lessening of competition in the relevant markets, and as such, the PCC resolved that it will take no further action with respect to the Transaction (the PCC Decision).
Other than the issuance of the PCC Decision, there are other conditions precedent that are required for the closing and completion of the Transaction.
On March 20, 2018, SMC Global completed the acquisition.

The estimates above will be updated to their fair values as at the date of acquisition when the Transaction is closed for purposes of recognizing the business combination and will involve identification and recognition of identifiable assets or intangible assets and will likely reduce the amount of initial goodwill above.

As of December 31, 2017, SMC Global incurred acquisition-related costs of P195 million which have been included in the “Selling and administrative expenses” account in the consolidated statements of income.
Goodwill expected to arise from the Transaction is attributable to the benefit of expected synergies, revenue growth, future development and the assembled workforce. These benefits are not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets.
