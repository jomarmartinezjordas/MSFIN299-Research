The Group’s consolidated sales revenue reached P1,024,943 million in 2018, 24% higher than the previous year mainly driven by higher volumes and favorable selling prices across all major businesses.
Cost of sales increased by 28% to P825,748 million mainly due to the increase in crude prices and effect of excise tax of Petron Corporation (Petron); higher sales volume of San Miguel Brewery Inc. (SMB) and the Food Segment; increase in excise tax by 4% per case of the domestic operations of SMB and operations of the newly acquired Masinloc Power Partners Co. Ltd. (MPPCL or the Masinloc Group) and the new Greenfield power plants in Bataan and Davao.
Selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher personnel expenses, distribution costs, contracted services costs and advertising and promotions.
Consolidated operating income increased by 5% at P117,085 million. This growth was however partly softened by higher raw material costs that impacted Petron and the Food businesses.
The higher net financing costs was mainly due to the higher level of loans payable and long- term debt in 2018 compared to 2017.
The decrease in equity in net earnings in 2018 primarily represents the share of SMC Global on the higher net loss of Angat Hydropower Corporation (Angat Hydro) and share of San Miguel Properties, Inc. (SMPI) on the lower earnings of Bank of Commerce (BOC).
The gain on sale of investments and property and equipment in 2018 pertains mainly to the sale by SMPI of its investment in Legacy Homes, Inc.
The increase in other charges was primarily due to the higher foreign exchange loss on the translation of the foreign currency denominated long-term debt and finance lease liabilities, partly offset by the higher gain on the translation of foreign currency denominated cash and cash equivalents with the peso depreciating by P2.65 from P49.93 in December 2017 to P52.58 in December 2018.
Consolidated recurring net income, excluding the effect of foreign exchange translation, amounted to P55,175 million, 1% higher than P54,654 million recorded in the previous year. Growth was tempered by the sharp decline in crude oil prices which affected Petron during the fourth quarter of 2018. Consolidated net income as a result, amounted to P48,648 million.

In 2018, SMC completed the consolidation of its Beer and NAB, Spirits and Food businesses through San Miguel Food and Beverage, Inc. (SMFB).
SMFB delivered a strong performance in 2018, posting consolidated revenues of P286,378 million, 14% higher than the P251,589 million recorded in 2017. This was driven by higher volumes and revenues across the Beer and NAB, Spirits and Food segments. Consolidated operating income and net income both increased 8% to P45,950 million and P30,533 million, respectively over last year.

SMB reported revenues amounting to P129,249 million, 14% higher from 2017, as volumes increased 10% to 284.6 million cases. Consolidated operating income rose 13% to P35,285 million while net income grew 15% to P23,836 million.

SMB’s domestic operations continued to be robust, with volumes growing 11% year-on- year as consumption across the country remained strong. Red Horse Beer and San Miguel Pale Pilsen maintained their position as SMB's top selling brands. Its performance was boosted by consumption-generating initiatives and defense programs which further strengthened the equity of SMB brands.
With facilities nearing full utilization, SMB is currently building a new brewery in Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental in Mindanao and converting its Sta. Rosa Bottling plant into a full brewery. This will add four million hectoliters to its total current capacity and help strengthen its distribution networks in Mindanao and Southern Luzon which will result to savings on logistics.

SMB’s International Operations benefitted from volume growth in its South China and Indonesia operations as well as Exports, and better sales mix. As such, despite continuing challenges in the business environment in North China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Thailand, SMB International registered double-digit growth in operating income.

GSMI recorded a banner year in 2018, sustaining strong sales volume which reached 31.4 million cases, 13% better than the last year. Flagship brand Ginebra San Miguel continued to drive growth, driven by its nationwide “Ginebra Ako” campaign, various on-ground activities and trade promotions. Vino Kulafu, its Chinese wine brand, also continued to post strong growth. The brand got a boost from its “Dosenang Lakas, May Instant Pa-Buenas” under-the-cap promo and tactical consumer activities in Visayas and Mindanao regions.
All these translated to revenues of P24,835 million, 19% higher than the previous year. Operating income surged 40% to P1,832 million, due to strong volumes and lower operating costs, while net income increased 75% to P1,053 million.

Food Segment posted consolidated revenues of P132,299 million, 13% higher than 2017, on account of the strong performance of the Animal Nutrition and Health, Protein, and Prepared and Packaged Food segments. Most of the food business segments registered double-digit revenue growth, resulting from increased sales volumes and better selling prices.
Revenues from the Animal Nutrition and Health segment, comprising the feeds and vetmed businesses, posted a revenue growth of 14%. Protein, which includes the poultry and fresh meats businesses, grew by 11% while the “Prepared and Packaged Food” expanded by 15%.
The rising costs of major raw materials, intense competition and the additional impact of peso depreciation, however, pulled Food Group’s operating income, down 7% to P9,182 million compared to the same period last year.
Net income fell 15% to P5,885 million, affected by a weaker peso, start-up and pre- operating expenses of the new facilities, and higher interest expenses related to its expansion projects.
Food Segment made significant strides in its ongoing expansion in 2018, completing new facilities that will provide much-needed additional capacities to serve the growing demand and changing preferences of consumers. These include feedmills in Bulacan and Bataan, and one hotdog plant in Cavite. Ongoing projects include additional feedmill facilities in Davao, Cebu and Cagayan de Oro, a flour mill in Mabini, Batangas and its first ready-to-eat facility in Sta. Rosa, Laguna that will cater to the growing demand for convenient, pre-prepared and pre-cooked meals.

The Packaging Group completed two acquisitions in 2018. In June, it acquired through San Miguel Yamamura Packaging International Ltd., JMP Holdings, a supplier of packaging products for various industries, including retail packaging, cargo protection, and materials handling. In January 2019, through San Miguel Yamamura Wooven Products Ltd., it acquired INSA Alliance Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian manufacturer of high quality bulk bags. The acquisition complements its existing woven bags plant in Malaysia.

Sales revenues for the year amounted to P37,325 million, 16% higher than 2017, as all business segments delivered solid results. Glass set record deliveries to SMB and GSMI; Metals benefited from a favorable sale mix for crowns; deliveries of Plastic crates and pallets were sustained; and logistics operations delivered significant growth with the increase in demand for rented pallets and trucking services.
The Packaging Group’s Australian operations continued to contribute significantly to overall growth, registering strong sales across the different operations.
With the implementation of stringent fixed cost management measures and further improvements in productivity, operating income grew 11% to P3,311 million.

SMC Global’s consolidated off-take volume for 2018 reached 23,864 gigawatt hours (Gwh), 39% higher than the previous year. Much of this growth was attributed to the start of commercial operations of Units 2 and 3 of the Malita and Limay Greenfield power plants in February and March, respectively. Together, these new units have brought online 300 megawatts (MW) of fresh capacity. With the acquisition of the Masinloc Power Plant in March 2018 which added a combined capacity of 684 MW, total installed capacity reached 4,197 MW in 2018.
With higher off-take volumes and average realization price, consolidated revenues rose 45% to P120,103 million from P82,791 million in the previous year. This was mainly driven by the additional revenues from the new greenfield power plants, the Masinloc power plant and higher average prices from the Sual and Ilijan bilateral and spot offtake volumes. Operating income reached P33,174 million, 37% higher while net income amounted to P8,300 million, 1% higher from last year, which was offset by the effect of forex movements.

Petron reported consolidated revenues of P557,386 million for 2018, 28% higher than the P434,624 million in the previous year which was mainly driven by strong domestic sales of high-margin products such as gasoline, Jet-A1 and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), on the account of higher prices of crude oil and finished products.
Petron’s consolidated volume reached 108.5 million barrels, slightly higher than the 107.8 million barrels sold in 2017, led by strong retail sales in Malaysia.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the oil industry has been challenged by increase in global oil production supply which saw crude prices falling sharply starting second half of October until December. Benchmark Dubai crude averaged at US$79.4 per barrel in October which fell to US$57.3 per barrel in December, a US$ 22.1 per barrel drop by year-end. This was also combined with substantially weak gasoline refining margins on the supply side factors.
Consolidated operating income and net income stood at P18,921 million and P7,069 million, 32% and 50% decline from 2017, respectively as a result of inventory losses incurred in November and December.
Petron’s Bataan refinery utilization in 2018 hit 95%, an all-time high for the refinery, enabling it to produce even more high-value fuels and petrochemicals. Petrochemical and polypropylene sales grew by 3% and 28%, respectively driving the export volume growth by 7%.
Petron stations continue to grow in the Philippines and Malaysia which is now over 2,400 and 640 stations, respectively.

SMC Infrastructure reported in 2018 revenues of P24,530 million, a 9% increase from the previous year, mainly driven by continuous growth in vehicular volume from all operating toll roads. As a result, operating income reached P11,828 million, 13% growth from 2017.
Construction of ongoing projects are on track. The 14.82-kilometer Skyway Stage 3 project is in the advanced stages of construction. The 88.82-kilometer Tarlac- Pangasinan-La Union Expressway is now operational up to the Pozzorubio exit. The last phase from Pozzorubio to Rosario, La Union, is currently under construction.
Construction of the 22-kilometer Mass Rail Transit Line (MRT-7) project, is progressing well. Work on the stretch from Quezon Memorial Circle to Quirino Highway traversing Commonwealth Ave. and Regalado Ave. in Quezon City, is partially complete.
Phase 1 of the Bulacan Bulk Water Supply Project was completed end of 2018. It has started supplying potable water to six Bulacan municipalities in the first quarter of 2019.

The increase was primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents, inventories, the consolidation of Masinloc Power assets, and the recognition of goodwill on the consolidation.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents by P37,077 million was mainly due to proceeds from the follow-on offering of SMFB common shares in November 2018.
The increase in trade and other receivables by P13,853 million was mainly attributable to the higher revenue of SMC Global, Petron and Food Segment, consolidation of Masinloc Group and increase in Petron Malaysia’s government subsidy receivable.

The increase in goodwill mainly represents the goodwill recognized as a result of the consolidation of the Masinloc Group.
Other intangible assets increased mainly due to the costs of various infrastructure projects of the Infrastructure Group net of amortization during the period.
Deferred tax assets increased by P837 million mainly due to the effect of recognition of higher unrealized foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated long-term debt and loans payable as a result of the depreciation of the Philippine Peso against the US Dollar in December 2018 compared to December 2017.
The increase in other noncurrent assets by P14,491 million was mainly due to the reclassification of advances to contractors of Universal LRT Corporation (BVI) Limited from current to noncurrent due to delay in MRT 7 Project completion, capitalized expenditures on the construction of MRT 7 Project, purchase of new containers by SMB and the consolidation of the Masinloc Group's other noncurrent assets.
The increase in loans payable by P34,161 million was mainly due to net availment of working capital loans and for general corporate purposes by Petron, Food Segment and SMC.
Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by P12,771 million mainly due to the consolidation of the balances of Masinloc entities, reclassification of SMB’s customer's container deposit from contra inventory account to liability due to the adoption of PFRS 15.
The increase in the current portion of finance lease liabilities mainly represents the reclassification from noncurrent portion to current portion of finance lease liabilities due in 2019 of Energy Group.
The P3,248 million increase in income and other taxes payable was mainly due to the higher excise tax of Petron and the contributed income tax and other payables of the Masinloc entities.
Dividends payable decreased primarily due to dividend payments made by Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corp and SMY Asia.

The increase in current maturities of long-term debt was mainly due to the reclassification to current liability of the amounts due in 2019.
The higher amount of long-term debt resulted from the loan availments made by SMC Global and SMC, and the issuance of fixed rate bonds by SMC Global to finance the acquisition of Masinloc Power, consolidation of the long-term debt of MPPCL, availment for investment and general corporate purposes, and loan availments by the Energy Group and the Infrastructure Group to finance capital expenditures.
The increase in deferred tax liability is mainly attributable to the temporary differences arising from interest expense, depreciation and foreign exchange.
The decrease in finance lease liabilities by P15,641 million was mainly due to payments, net of interest and the effect of foreign exchange rate changes.
Other noncurrent liabilities decreased primarily due to Petron's settlement of retirement liability and contribution to the retirement fund.
Equity reserves increased by P26,312 million mainly due to the effect of SMFB's share swap and the gain from the follow on offering of SMFB common shares, net of the redemption of USCS of Petron.
The increase in appropriated retained earnings by P5,930 million was mainly due to appropriations by SMFB net of the reversals of SMC Global, SMITS, Infrastructure Group, SMC Shipping and Lighterage Corporation (SMCSLC) and SMY Asia.
