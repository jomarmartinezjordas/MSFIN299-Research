The Group’s consolidated sales revenue for the year 2019 amounted to P1,020,502 million, at par versus 2018. Higher volumes from SMC Global Power Corp. (SMC Global) and San Miguel Food and Beverage, Inc. (SMFB) continue to drive revenue growth, but was moderated by the decline in the sales performance of Petron Corporation (Petron).
Cost of sales amounted to P818,815 million, slightly lower than 2018 at P825,748 million. The decrease primarily was the result of lower average crude prices and sales volume of Petron. This was reduced by the increase in: (a) full year operations of Masinloc Power Plant Units 1 and 2, Malita Power Plant Unit 2, and Limay Power Plant Unit 3, alongside Limay Power Plant Unit 4 which started operations in July 2019, (b) higher power purchase costs of Sual, Ilijan and San Roque Power Plants, (c) higher energy fees of Sual and Ilijan Power Plants, and (d) volume growth of SMFB and higher broiler cost, processing cost and major raw materials of the Food division.
Selling and administrative expenses increased by 5% to P85,972 million compared to last year, mainly due to (a) higher personnel expenses, logistics costs, contracted services costs and marketing expenses of SMFB, and (b) higher operating expenses of Masinloc entities’ full year operations. The increase was partly offset by lower employee costs, provision for bad debts and advertising expenses of Petron.
The Group’s consolidated operating income declined by 1% at P115,715 million, from last year, weighed down by Petron and SMFB - Food division. This was partly offset by SMFB’s Beer and Spirits divisions and the Energy business which delivered strong results during the period.
The higher interest expense and other financing charges was mainly due to higher level of long-term debt and generally higher interest rate in 2019 compared to 2018.
The higher interest income was primarily due to higher interest rate and average balance of cash and money market placements.
The increase in equity in net earnings mainly represents the share of San Miguel Properties, Inc. (SMPI) on Bank of Commerce (BOC) higher earnings and the share of San Miguel Holdings Corp. (SMHC) on the earnings of Manila North Harbour Port Inc. (MNHPI) for the period May to December 2019, net of the share in higher net losses of the Group’s Joint Ventures.
The loss on sale of investments and property and equipment in 2019 pertains mainly to the disposal and retirement by San Miguel Yamamura Packaging Corporation (SMYPC) of its Cebu Beverage Packaging Plant.
Other income - net in 2019 was primarily due to the appreciation of the Philippine Peso by P1.945 versus other charges - net in 2018 where the Philippine Peso depreciated by P2.65 in 2018. This resulted to a foreign exchange gain of P5,422 million in 2019 compared to a foreign exchange loss of P9,714 million in 2018.
The higher income tax expense was primarily due to the: (a) higher provision for deferred income tax expense recognized by the Energy business on the temporary difference of monthly fixed payments to Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) over the finance lease-related expenses and the temporary differences on foreign exchange translation and capitalized borrowing costs, and (b) higher taxable income of San Miguel Brewery (SMB). This was partially offset by lower provision for income tax recognized by Petron, SMFB - Food division and San Miguel Energy Corporation (SMEC) due to the decline in taxable income.
Consolidated net income amounted to P48,574 million, at par from last year.
Share of non-controlling interests increased in 2019 mainly due to the higher share of non- controlling interests on SMC Global’s Undated Subordinated Capital Securities (USCS) and Senior Perpetual Capital Securities (SPCS) distribution and SMFB’s higher net income, partly offset by lower net income of Petron.

SMFB consolidated revenue for the year ended at P310,785 million, 9% higher than the P286,378 million reported in 2018, on account of strong volumes from the Beer and Spirits divisions and better selling prices. Consolidated operating income grew 4% versus last year to P47,781 million, mainly driven by the Beer and Spirits divisions sustained strong performance. This was partly offset by the slowdown in the Food division.
Net income rose 6% over the previous year to P32,279 million.

SMB sustained its volume growth, concluding the year with consolidated volumes of 301.6 million cases, up 6% from 2018. Consolidated revenues and operating income were both 10% higher at P142,272 million and P38,720 million, respectively. Net income grew 14% to P27,285 million.

Domestic operations sold 275.3 million cases, up 7% from the previous year. This was mainly the result of engaging brand and trade activations coupled with sustained economic expansion, low inflation, election-related spending, and better employment conditions. Red Horse and San Miguel Pale Pilsen maintained their position as the top selling beer brands. Both benefitted from nationwide activations and consumer promo events such as “Pasiklaban”, “4Kicks”, “Rocker Chicks” and “Astig” for Red Horse and “Logiclub” for San Miguel Pale Pilsen, alongside other volume-generating programs.
SMB completed its new beer production facility in Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental in the fourth quarter of 2019 and, to date, is awaiting the necessary government permits to start commercial operations.

SMB’s international operations delivered revenue and operating income growth, despite a slight drop in volumes. This was on the back of strong results from Thailand operations and the Exports business, along with significant improvements in Vietnam, South China, and Hong Kong.
Distribution and marketing enhancements and penetration programs were put in place to accelerate volume growth of San Miguel brands – San Miguel Pale Pilsen, Red Horse, San Mig Light, and Cerveza Negra – and local brands. These included geographical expansion and the launch of new prodcuts in all countries with operations.

Ginebra San Miguel Inc. (GSMI) posted a full-year net income of P1,672 million, 59% higher than the previous year – the highest income recorded in the last 15 years. Volumes grew 14% from 2018 at 35.9 million cases. Much of this growth is attributed to the success of thematic campaigns, “Pilipino Ako, Ginebra Ako” for Ginebra San Miguel and “I Choose Mojito” for GSM Blue. Wider sales distribution, trade promotions and various on-ground activities for consumers also helped boost volumes. Vino Kulafu, GSMI’s Chinese wine brand, continued to post strong growth in Visayas and Mindanao regions while Primera Light Brandy also delivered healthy growth.
Before the end of 2019, GSMI launched a new campaign, “One Ginebra Nation”, espousing unity among Filipinos which is expected to boost volume growth further for GSMI.
Total revenues reached P29,063 million, up 17%. Operating income hit P2,878 million, 57% higher than the previous year, as a result of better margins deriving from operational improvements across the supply chain.

SMFB’s Food division generated consolidated revenues of P139,459 million, 5% higher than last year, on the back of higher volumes, better selling prices, and an improved product mix across most of business segments.
 The Protein segment, composed of Poultry and Fresh Meats, registered a 7% growth in revenues as volumes from chicken stations, lechon manok outlets, and major food service chains, increased. The improvement in poultry prices following the re-imposition of special safeguard duties on imported frozen

chicken, also helped boost sales. Revenues from fresh meats however declined, due to restrictions imposed by several Local Government Units on pork products, in a bid to curb the spread of African Swine Flu (ASF).
 Animal Nutrition & Health segment revenues declined by 2%, following lower commercial volumes due to its portfolio rationalization. Sales of broiler and layer feeds were also lower as commercial raisers held back output, following the glut in chicken prices. This was cushioned by strong hog feeds sales prior to the ASF outbreak.
 Prepared and Packaged Food segment revenues grew 8% on the back of the strong performance of its core products and favorable selling prices of value- added meats, butter, margarine, dairy spreads, biscuits and coffee. The segment also benefitted from an improved product mix, specifically, a shift to higher- margin products and the conversion of some of pork-based products to chicken- based formulations, as in the case of the newly launched Purefoods Fiesta Ham Chicken.
 Flour revenues grew 11%, driven by better selling prices and healthy volume growth resulting from additional capacity from our new flour mill.
Net income for the Food division amounted to P3,449 million.
The Food division has built four new feed mills. Two facilities are in Luzon, in Bataan and San Ildefonso, and both started commercial operations in 2019. Two other feed mills in Davao and Misamis Oriental are both undergoing commissioning. The Food division has expanded its poultry breeder farm in Bataan and is constructing new poultry processing plant in Quezon and Davao. An additional flour milling facility is being commissioned in Mabini, Batangas and is expected to be operational by early 2020.

The SMYPC’s performance remained stable throughout 2019. Sales revenues for the year amounted to P37,874 million, a slight increase from last year. This was largely due to steady demand for the Packaging Group’s largest segments, Glass, Metal, and Flexibles businesses. The Packaging Group’s Malaysia operations also performed strongly as did its Logistics Services’ operations, following increased demand for trucking services and pallet rentals.
Operating income reached P3,598 million, 9% higher than 2018, driven by Glass and Metal volumes. Packaging saw higher orders from the Beer and Spirits businesses, as well as carbonated soft-drinks customers, supported by programs to improve efficiencies and better management of fixed costs.

SMC Global registered consolidated revenues of P135,060 million, 12% higher than the P120,103 million it reported in 2018. This was on the back of an 18% increase in off-take volumes at 28,112 Gwh brought about by the full year operation of Masinloc Power Plants Unit 1 and 2, Unit 2 of Malita Power Plant and Unit 3 of the Limay Power Plant. Unit 4 of the Limay Power Plant also provided additional capacity starting July 2019. In addition, the Ilijan Power Plant posted higher revenues from its bilateral and spot sales in 2019.
Consolidated operating income grew 8% at P35,954 million from 2018, while net income surged 73% to P14,364 million.

Petron faced multiple challenges during the year, foremost of which were significantly weaker refining margins and volatile global prices due to political tensions in the Middle East and uncertainties in the global economy. The price of Dubai crude declined from an average of US$69 per barrel in 2018 to US$63 per barrel in 2019. This was compounded by the shutdown of the Bataan refinery due to an earthquake in April. The effect of the second tranche of the excise tax increase and proliferation of white stations, also had an adverse effect on Petron’s overall performance.
As a result, Petron’s consolidated revenues amounted to P514,362 million, down 8% versus 2018, mainly on account of lower average selling price of fuel, and a slight decline in volumes, which ended at 107 million barrels. Philippine operations volume declined by 5% following the unplanned total plant shutdown which began in April 2019. Petron Malaysia’s domestic volumes meanwhile grew by 3%, helping offset the decline in Philippine volumes.
Operating income was also down by 14% at P16,199 million, the result of lower margins of petroleum and petrochemical products due to the combined effects of oversupply, a slowdown in demand, and the temporary cessation of refinery operations. This was partly cushioned by its extensive fixed cost savings initiatives and continued emphasis on operational efficiencies.
Petron’s consolidated net income settled at P2,303 million, down by 67% from 2018’s P7,069 million.
Despite this setback, Petron continues to expand its service station network to reach even more customers. In 2019, Petron opened 124 new stations, bringing its total to 2,435 service stations in the Philippines and to almost 700 in Malaysia.

The Infrastructure business recorded a combined 5% volume growth for the year from all of its operating toll roads. Consolidated revenues reached P23,406 million, while operating income amounted to P11,444 million.
Construction of our major infrastructure projects remain on going. This however was temporarily suspended starting on March 17, 2020 when the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) was implemented in Luzon by the Philippine government to control the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Construction activities gradually resumed after the restrictions in construction activities were partially allowed in some area until it was totally lifted on May 15, 2020.
The 89.21-kilometer Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEX) has been operational from Tarlac to Pozzorubio while the last phase from Pozzorubio to Rosario, La Union, is almost complete. This phase was temporarily opened to the public in December 2019 which was closed after the holiday season to give way for its completion.
Construction of the 22-kilometer Mass Rail Transit (MRT 7) Project, is likewise progressing well. Work on the section from Quezon Memorial Circle to Quirino Highway traversing Commonwealth Avenue and Regalado Avenue in Quezon City was accelerated to reach the goal of partial operation by 2021.

The Skyway Stage 3 that will link South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) to North Luzon Expressway is in the advanced stages of completion, despite suffering a setback on February 1, 2020 from a fire in Pandacan, Manila. Approximately 300 meters of Section 2B, which was already substantially complete, was affected. Prior to work suspension due to ECQ, SMC Infrastructure had been working 24/7 to reconstruct this section and targeting to complete the Skyway 3 Project by July this year.
SLEX – Toll Road 4 (SLEX-TR4), the 56.862-kilometer extension of the SLEX from Sto. Tomas, Batangas to Lucena City in Quezon province has started construction. Works from Alaminos, Laguna and Tiaong, Quezon is currently ongoing.
Construction of the new passenger terminal in Boracay airport has been slowed down to give way for groundwater works and well development. Both projects are partially completed.
Meanwhile, the Concession Agreement for the New Manila International Airport was signed last September 18, 2019. A game-changing infrastructure project, its detail technical design and requirements for its financial close is currently on-going.

On March 14 and April 26, 2019, respectively, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the Philippine Ports Authority approved the transfer of equivalent to 15.17% shareholdings in MNHPI to International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI). With the approval of the additional ownership in MNHPI, the total equity interest of ICTSI increased from 34.83% to 50%, while SMHC’s shares remained at 43.33%.
As a result, MNHPI ceased to be a subsidiary of SMHC. The Group derecognized the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of MNHPI, and the carrying amount of non- controlling interest as at April 26, 2019, and recognized the investment at fair market value amounting to P2,600 million.

Consolidated total assets as at December 31, 2019 amounted to about P1,817,734 million, P141,092 million higher than December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and the recognition of right-of-use assets with the adoption of PFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2019 by P43,307 million is mainly due to the issuance of SPCS by SMC Global, preferred shares of Petron and loan availment of the Parent Company.
The increase in trade and other receivables by P6,595 million is mainly due to Petron’s higher fuel prices and excise tax of fuel products, higher revenue of the Beer and Food divisions under SMFB, SCPC and MPPCL, partly offset by the decrease in Petron Malaysia’s government subsidy receivable.
The increase in inventories by P8,517 million is mainly due to Petron’s higher volume of finished product and price of crude and the incremental excise tax-imposed beginning 2019.
The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets by P5,458 million was primarily due to the: (a) decrease in Petron's input tax, goods and services tax and other prepaid taxes as a result of collection of input tax claim from the government and also utilization of input tax for the period, and (b) decrease in CCEC's restricted cash balance. The decrease was partly offset by Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) received by SMB for the San Mig Light tax cases, and increase in Infrastructure Group's input taxes.
The increase in investments and advances was attributable to the reclassification of SMHC's investment in MNHPI from subsidiary to joint venture, net of the reclassification by SMC Global of its investment in Mariveles Power Generation Corporation (MPGC) to investment in subsidiary.
The decrease in property, plant and equipment by P130,758 million and corresponding increase in right-of-use assets by P173,604 million, primarily represents the reclassification to right-of-use assets of the power plants as a result of the adoption of PFRS 16.
The increase in investment property was mainly due to the set up of right-of-use assets of Petron for its rented properties being sub-leased to external parties.

The decrease in deferred tax assets was mainly due to derecognized deferred tax on NOLCO of the Parent Company which expired in 2019.
The increase in other noncurrent assets by P22,764 million was mainly due to the: (a) advances to suppliers and contractors for the construction of the Mariveles Power Plant and battery energy storage system project, (b) purchase of new containers by SMB, and (c) capitalized costs on the construction of MRT 7 and Section 3A-2 (Binalonan to Pozzorubio) of the TPLEX project.
The decrease in loans payable by P14,532 million was mainly due to net payment of Petron and deconsolidation of MNHPI.
The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses by P26,273 million was mainly due to Petron's higher liabilities for crude and petroleum products on account of higher prices and more outstanding shipments as of end-2019 versus 2018, and higher outstanding payable to contractors of Infrastructure Group and MPGC.
The increase in lease liabilities - current portion pertains to the recognition of current lease liabilities for right-of-use assets as a result of the adoption of PFRS 16 and the reclassification from noncurrent to current of the lease liabilities under Independent Power Producer Administration agreements due up to December 31, 2020 by the Energy business.
The increase in income and other taxes payable was mainly due to SMB's higher taxable income.
The increase in long-term debt (current and noncurrent) was due to the: (a) issuance of P30,000 million fixed-rate Peso-denominated bonds by SMC Global, (b) availment of the US$800 million long-term loan facility by Petron, and (c) issuance of P16,000 million long-term corporate notes, P10,000 million fixed-rate Peso-denominated bonds and US$50 million term loan by the Parent Company, and (d) net loan availments of Food Group, Packaging Group, Masinloc and Infrastructure Group. The increase was partially offset by the: (a) redemption of Series C and E bonds of SMB, (b) settlement of maturing obligations by Petron, the Energy business and SMC, and (c) foreign currency adjustment on the US Dollar-denominated loans.
The increase in deferred tax liability was mainly attributable to the temporary differences arising from interest and forex on the dollar-denominated finance lease liabilities of South Premiere Power Corp. (SPPC), SMEC and Strategic Power Devt. Corp. (SPDC), net of the decrease in deferred tax liability of Petron due to recognition of NOLCO for 2019.
The decrease in other noncurrent liabilities was mainly due to the deconsolidation of MNHPI.
The decrease in equity reserves by P7,123 million pertains to (1) Equity reserve from the redemption of USCS by SMC Global (2) the currency translation adjustments for the period resulting from the appreciation of Peso against the US Dollar and (3) the equity reserve for retirement plan.
The decrease in the group's appropriated retained earnings by P16,131 million is attributable to the reversals made by Energy Group for the portion of paid fixed monthly payments to PSALM by SPPC, SMEC and SPDC.
The increase in unappropriated retained earnings by P24,747 million was primarily due to the net reversal of appropriations and net income for the period net of cash dividends.
The increase in Treasury shares was due to the redemption by the Parent Company of its 90,428,200 Series "2" Preferred Shares - Subseries B on September 23, 2019.
The increase in non-controlling interests by P67,737 million pertains to the (1) issuance of SPCS by SMC Global; (2) issuance of Preferred Shares by Petron; and (3) share of non-controlling interests on the group's net earnings net of dividend for the period, the increase was offset by: (1) redemption of USCS by SMC Global; (2) redemption of Preferred Shares by Petron; and (3) the effect of deconsolidation of MNHPI.

The unappropriated retained earnings of the Parent Company is restricted in the amount of P67,093 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, representing the cost of common shares held in treasury.
The unappropriated retained earnings of the Group include the accumulated earnings in subsidiaries and equity in net earnings of associates and joint ventures not available for declaration as dividends until declared by the respective investees.
