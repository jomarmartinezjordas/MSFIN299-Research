SM Prime recorded consolidated revenues of P90.92 billion in the year ended 2017, an increase of 14% from P79.82 billion in the year ended 2016, primarily due to the following:

SM Prime recorded consolidated revenues from rent of P51.41 billion in 2017, an increase of 13% from P45.69 billion in 2016.

Out of the total rental revenues, 88% is contributed by the malls and the rest from office and hotels and convention centers. Excluding the new malls and expansions, same-store rental growth is at 7%. Room rentals from hotels and convention centers likewise increased due to the opening of Conrad Manila in June 2016 and the improvement in average room rates and occupancy rates of the hotels and convention centers as a result of ASEAN-related events held throughout 2017.



SM Prime recorded an 18% increase in real estate sales in 2017 from P25.00 billion to P29.43 billion primarily due to higher construction accomplishments of projects launched in 2013 up to 2016 namely Shore, Shore 2, Air, Fame, S Residences and Silk Residences in China and continued increase in sales take-up of Ready-for-Occupancy (RFO) projects due to strong demand fueled by OFW remittances, sustained growth of the BPO sector, government spending and rising disposable income of the emerging middle class.

SM Prime cinema and event ticket sales increased to P4.77 billion in 2017 from P4.67 billion in 2016 due to decrease in both local and international blockbuster movies shown in 2017 compared to 2016.

Other revenues increased by 19% to P5.31 billion in 2017 from P4.46 billion in 2016. The increase was mainly due to opening of new amusement attractions as a result of new malls and expansions and increase in hotels’ food and beverages income due to the opening of Conrad Manila.
