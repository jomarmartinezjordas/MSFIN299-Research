There is continuing recovery in economic activity and business volumes with the steady easing of community quarantine measures in the major business areas in the country and the consumers adjusting to the new normal living conditions. In the second half of the year, profitability improved across Retail, Property and Banking as the retail stores and malls have fully opened in time for the holiday season. The recovery in the 2nd half is also attributable to reduced restrictions on mobility although limited in momentum until the threat of the pandemic dissipates.

Merchandise Sales, which decreased by 18.2% to P289.7 billion from P354.1 billion in 2019, accounts for 73.5% of total revenues in 2020.

Actual construction of projects usually starts within twelve to eighteen months from launch date and revenues are recognized based on percentage of completion.

Rent Revenue, derived mainly from the mall operations of SM Prime, decreased by 47.8% to P26.9 billion from P51.6 billion in 2019.

During the quarantine period, certain stores and malls of the Group had to temporarily stop operations.

To assist its mall tenants, SM Prime granted waivers on rent and/or extended rental discounts that totaled to P23.3 billion as at yearend 2020.
COVID-19 did not have any significant impact on SM Prime’s offices business since its primary tenants are business process outsourcing (BPO) offices which were allowed by the Philippine’s Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) to continue to operate throughout the quarantine period.
Select hotels of the Group, Conrad Manila, Park Inn Clark, Park Inn North EDSA and Park Inn Iloilo remained operational during the quarantine period as these hotels catered to BPO employees and returning overseas Filipino workers/seafarers. The Group’s biggest events center, the Mall of Asia Arena, was converted into a Mega Swabbing Facility in partnership with various government agencies. With the easing of quarantine measures throughout the country, SM Prime’s hotels have started to commence operations.

The Group’s receivables from real estate sales increased by P30.5 billion or 45.7% from yearend 2019.

The net cash flow from operations decreased by P37.2 billion or 56.1% to P29.1 billion as a result of the significant drop in net income depicting the extensive impact of COVID-19 to the Group’s operations.

To support the Group’s operational and capital expenditure requirements, (1) the Group availed an additional P44.5 billion of debt, net availment, and, (2), SMIC Parent and SM Prime lowered their dividend payout in 2020 to P5.1 billion from P11.0 billion and P5.3 billion from P10.5 billion in 2019, respectively.
