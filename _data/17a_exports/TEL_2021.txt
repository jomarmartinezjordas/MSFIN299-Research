We reported consolidated revenues of Php193,257 million in 2021, an increase of Php12,253 million, or 7%, as compared with Php181,004 million in 2020, primarily due to higher revenues from broadband and data services in our Wireless and Fixed Line business segments, and higher revenues from voice services in our Fixed Line business segment, partially offset by lower revenues from voice and SMS services in our Wireless business segment.
Our consolidated service revenues of Php185,751 million in 2021, increased by Php12,117 million, or 7%, from Php173,634 million in 2020. Our consolidated non-service revenues of Php7,506 million in 2021, increased by Php136 million, or 2%, from Php7,370 million in 2020.
Consolidated service revenues, net of interconnection costs, amounted to Php182,053 million in 2021, an increase of Php10,565 million, or 6%, from Php171,488 million in 2020.
In 2019, R.A. 11202, otherwise known as the Mobile Number Portability, or MNP, Act, was enacted, which provides that a customer can retain his mobile number when he moves from one mobile service provider to another or, changes the type of subscription from postpaid to prepaid or vice versa. The Act also provides that no interconnection fee or charge shall be imposed by any mobile service provider for domestic calls and SMS made by a subscriber. Thus, effective January 2, 2020, we removed the mobile interconnection fees for domestic calls and SMS, which were formerly priced at Php0.50 per minute for voice calls and Php0.05 per message for SMS.
Availment of MNP core services was made available to Smart, Globe and Dito subscribers starting September 30, 2021. The Smart MNP program allows internal porting wherein a subscriber moves from postpaid to a prepaid subscription, or vice versa, within the Smart network, while it also allows external porting wherein a Globe or Dito subscriber switches to Smart or vice versa.
MNP is free of charge to the subscriber but there are basic requirements for the subscriber to comply in order for the application to proceed. External porting requires a unique subscriber code, or USC, to be issued by the subscriber’s existing network provider. The USC serves as a clearance that the account is free from unpaid fees and balances. There is no limit to the number of times that a subscriber may apply for the MNP. However, a subscriber may only be allowed to apply again after 60 days from the last successful porting activation.
On January 29, 2021, PLDT and Smart entered into a Sale/Purchase Agreement for the transfer of PLDT’s Prepaid Home WiFi, or PHW, subscribers to Smart to consolidate fixed wireless services under Smart. The transfer of PHW subscribers took effect on March 1, 2021 after complying with the NTC’s required 30-day notice to subscribers.

Our consolidated revenues are further segmented by market, based on the type of customers served. “Home” refers to household subscribers, “Individual” covers mobile wireless individual customers, “Enterprise” encompasses business- based customers, corporate or micro, small and medium enterprises, and “International” refers to international carrier customers.

Consolidated expenses increased by Php7,674 million, or 5%, to Php152,496 million in 2021 from Php144,822 million in 2020, primarily due to higher interconnection costs, and depreciation and amortization in our Fixed Line and Wireless business segments, as well as higher cost of sales and services in our Wireless business segment, partially offset by lower provisions in our Fixed Line and Wireless business segments.

Consolidated other expenses – net amounted to Php6,607 million in 2021, an increase of Php3,446 million, or 109%, from Php3,161 million in 2020, primarily due to the combined effects of the following: (i) foreign exchange losses in 2021 as against foreign exchange gains in 2020 from our Fixed Line and Wireless business segments; (ii) lower equity share in net losses from our Other business segment; and (iii) gains on derivative financial instruments in 2021 as against losses on derivative financial instruments from our Fixed Line and Wireless business segments.

Consolidated net income increased by Php2,096 million, or 9%, to Php26,676 million in 2021 from Php24,580 million in 2020, primarily due to higher net income from our Fixed Line and Other business segments, partially offset by lower net income from our Wireless business segment. Our consolidated basic and diluted EPS increased to Php121.76 in 2021 from Php112.12 in 2020. Our weighted average number of outstanding common shares was approximately 216.06 million in each of 2021 and 2020.

Our consolidated EBITDA amounted to Php95,900 million in 2021, an increase of Php9,742 million, or 11%, as compared with Php86,158 million in 2020, primarily due to higher EBITDA from our Fixed Line and Wireless business segments.

Our consolidated EBITDA excluding manpower rightsizing program, or MRP, amounted to Php96,169 million in 2021, an increase of Php7,386 million, or 8%, as compared with Php88,783 million in 2020. Adjusted for the impact of Typhoon Odette, our consolidated EBITDA excluding MRP would have been Php97,060 million, an increase of Php8,277 million, or 9% from last year.

Our consolidated core income amounted to Php29,937 million in 2021, an increase of Php2,808 million, or 10%, as compared with Php27,129 million in 2020, mainly on account of higher EBITDA, lower provision for income tax, and lower equity share in net losses of associates and joint ventures, partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization and financing costs, and lower other miscellaneous income. Our consolidated basic and diluted core EPS increased to Php138.29 in 2021 from Php125.29 in 2020.

Our consolidated telco core income amounted to Php30,233 million in 2021, an increase of Php2,146 million, or 8%, as compared with Php28,087 million in 2020, mainly due to higher EBITDA and lower provision for income tax, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization, and financing costs. Excluding the impact of Typhoon Odette, our consolidated telco core income would have been Php31,029 million, an increase of Php2,942 million, or 10% from last year.

Mobile broadband revenues amounted to Php2,797 million in 2021, a decrease of Php374 million, or 12%, from Php3,171 million in 2020, primarily due to subscribers’ shift to fiber and fixed wireless solutions due to the prolonged pandemic and subsequent extension of community quarantine restrictions.
In August 2021, Smart launched Smart Bro Rocket SIM aimed at heavy wireless broadband users. Smart Bro Rocket SIM provides unlimited data valid for 30 days at an introductory price of Php499. Mobile broadband services accounted for 3% of our mobile service revenues in each of 2021 and 2020.

Revenues from our other data services, which include value-added services, or VAS, and domestic leased lines, increased by Php294 million, or 24%, to Php1,527 million in 2021 from Php1,233 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues from VAS via direct carrier billing, driven by various online activities and transactions, including mobile gaming in-app purchases and tollways reloading fees.

Mobile revenues from our voice services, which include all voice traffic, decreased by Php3,768 million, or 17%, to Php17,774 million in 2021 from Php21,542 million in 2020, due to subscribers’ shift to alternative calling options, digital teleconferencing solutions, and other OTT services. In view of these new digital solutions and to improve its voice service, Smart has been provisioning its mobile users for Voice over LTE, or VoLTE, and Voice over WiFi, or VoWiFi, services which routes the voice calls through digital channels. VoLTE and VoWiFi offer better voice quality. Mobile voice services accounted for 18% and 22% of our mobile service revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Domestic voice service revenues decreased by Php3,239 million, or 17%, to Php15,683 million in 2021 from Php18,922 million in 2020, mainly due to lower traffic from domestic outbound and inbound voice services.
International voice service revenues decreased by Php529 million, or 20%, to Php2,091 million in 2021 from Php2,620 million in 2020 resulting from lower traffic driven by the prolonged impact of the pandemic in international travel, partially offset by revenues from international voice agreement with international carriers.

Mobile revenues from our SMS services, which include all SMS-related services, decreased by Php334 million, or 5%, to Php6,603 million in 2021 from Php6,937 million in 2020, mainly due to the decline in SMS volumes arising from the increased adoption of alternative messaging solutions, such as OTT services, social media, and messenger application, partially offset by the Application-to-Person (“A2P”) service revenues. Mobile SMS services accounted for 7% of our mobile service revenues in each of 2021 and 2020.

Mobile revenues from inbound roaming and other services decreased by Php839 million, or 36%, to Php1,517 million in 2021 from Php2,356 million in 2020, mainly due to lower facility service fees related to fixed wireless business and lower revenues from inbound roaming services, partly offset by higher other subscriber-related income.

Revenues generated from our mobile prepaid services amounted to Php76,635 million in 2021, an increase of Php845 million, or 1%, as compared with Php75,790 million in 2020. Mobile prepaid service revenues accounted for 79% and 78% of mobile service revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in revenues from our mobile prepaid services was attributed to higher average daily top-ups driven by the sustained growth in mobile internet usage, partially offset by lower subscriber base. Decline in prepaid subscribers was due to lower activations as subscribers were less mobile and more apt to use home WiFi due to the protracted pandemic.
In October 2020, we implemented the rebranding of Sun Prepaid to Smart Prepaid. Subscribers retained their existing Sun numbers while having access to expanded retail and customer care channels, data-centric Giga offers alongside existing select Sun top-up offers. With this development, Sun subscribers can already avail of the GigaLife bundles using Smart’s LTE network.

Revenues generated from our mobile postpaid services amounted to Php18,386 million in 2021, a decrease of Php1,034 million, or 5%, as compared with Php19,420 million in 2020, primarily due to a decline in the postpaid subscriber base. Mobile postpaid service revenues accounted for 19% and 20% of mobile service revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Our wireless non-service revenues increased by Php939 million, or 16%, to Php6,980 million in 2021 from Php6,041 million in 2020, primarily due to a higher revenue per unit of mobile handsets issued and PHW broadband routers issued in 2021.

Expenses associated with our Wireless business segment amounted to Php89,172 million in 2021, an increase of Php7,603 million, or 9%, from Php81,569 million in 2020. The increase was attributable to higher depreciation and amortization, cost of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses, asset impairment and interconnection costs, partially offset by lower provisions. As a percentage of our total wireless revenues, expenses associated with our Wireless business segment accounted for 84% and 78% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Depreciation and amortization charges increased by Php5,325 million, or 15%, to Php40,459 million, mainly on account of higher depreciable asset base resulting from significant capitalization, combined with higher depreciation of right-of- use asset.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by Php1,017 million, or 3%, to Php36,748 million, primarily due to higher expenses related to repairs and maintenance, professional and other contracted services, amortization of intangibles, and rent, partly offset by lower expenses related to taxes and licenses, selling and promotions, and compensation and employee benefits.

Cost of sales and services increased by Php2,000 million, or 25%, to Php10,041 million, primarily due to a higher number of units issued and higher average cost per unit for mobile handsets, as well as the cost of PHW broadband routers issued in 2021.

(2) Technical transformation of the PLDT Group’s service delivery platform in order to realize operating and cost efficiencies, provision of greater resilience and redundancy for the network, and investments in additional cable systems;
(3) Continuing investments to expand our LTE and 5G coverage; and
(4) IT/Support Systems –upgrade of our IT and support systems.
We expect to fund incremental capital expenditures from internally generated funds, loan financing, and proceeds from sale of non-strategic assets.

See Note 28 – Financial Assets and Liabilities – Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 7. “Financial Statements” for a detailed discussion on our treasury policies and objectives in terms of the manner in which treasury activities are controlled.

Proceeds from availment of long-term debt in 2021 amounted to Php51,500 million, mainly from PLDT’s and Smart’s drawings related to refinancing of maturing loan obligations and financing of capital expenditure requirements. Payments of principal, including prepayments of Php4,783 million, amounted to Php22,565 million while payments of interest on our total debt amounted to Php8,891 million in 2021.
Proceeds from availment of long-term and short-term debts in 2020 amounted to Php61,271 million and Php10,000 million, respectively, mainly from PLDT’s issuance of fixed rate U.S. Dollar notes and PLDT’s and Smart’s drawings related to refinancing of maturing loan obligations, prepayment of outstanding loans and financing of capital expenditure requirements. Payments of principal on our long-term and short-term debts in 2020 amounted to Php28,365 million and Php10,000 million, respectively, while payment of interest amounted to Php8,348 million.
Our consolidated long-term debt increased by Php29,792 million, or 13%, to Php252,557 million as at December 31, 2021 from Php222,765 million as at December 31, 2020, primarily due to drawings from our long-term facilities, partially offset by debt amortizations and prepayments. As at December 31, 2021, PLDT’s long-term debt level increased by Php13,006 million, or 9%, to Php157,007 million from Php144,001 million as at December 31, 2020, while Smart’s long-term debt level increased by Php16,786 million, or 21%, to Php95,550 million from Php78,764 as at December 31, 2020.

See Note 21 – Interest-bearing Financial Liabilities – Long-term Debt to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 7. “Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of our long-term debt.

Our consolidated debt instruments contain restrictive covenants, including covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and other financial tests, calculated in conformity with PFRS, at relevant measurement dates, principally at the end of each quarterly period. We have complied with all of our maintenance financial ratios as required under our loan covenants and other debt instruments.
As at December 31, 2021 and 2020, we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

We believe that our available cash, including cash flow from operating activities, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our projected operating, investment, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next 12 months; however, we may finance a portion of these costs from external sources if we consider it prudent to do so.

None of our existing indebtedness contains provisions under which credit rating downgrades would trigger a default, changes in applicable interest rates or other similar terms and conditions.

On March 18, 2021, Moody’s affirmed PLDT’s long term local currency issuer rating at “Baa2”. Rating is considered “investment grade.” The outlook is stable.
On November 26, 2020, S&P Global affirmed our long-term foreign issuer credit rating at “BBB+”, with a stable outlook, and also, on our senior unsecured notes programs at “BBB+”. These ratings are considered as “investment grade.”

On January 28, 2021, Fitch affirmed, on unsolicited basis, PLDT’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating and long-term local currency issuer default rating at “BBB”, with a stable outlook. On the same date, Fitch has withdrawn all of PLDT’s ratings for commercial reasons.
On January 6, 2014, CRISP rated PLDT’s inaugural peso retail bonds as “AAA” issuer rating with a “stable” outlook, the highest on the scale. CRISP cited PLDT’s market leadership, strong historical financial performance and excellent management and governance as key considerations for providing their rating. As at March 22, 2022, there has been no change in the credit rating issued by CRISP.

Our total assets amounted to Php626,328 million as at December 31, 2021, an increase of Php50,482 million, or 9%, from Php575,846 million as at December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher property and equipment, and prepayments, partly offset by lower cash and cash equivalents.
Our total assets amounted to Php575,846 million as at December 31, 2020, an increase of Php50,819 million, or 10%, from Php525,027 million as at December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher property and equipment, prepayments, and cash and cash equivalents.
Our total liabilities amounted to Php498,863 million as at December 31, 2021, an increase of Php42,682 million, or 9%, from Php456,181 million as at December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher interest-bearing financial liabilities and accounts payable
Our total liabilities amounted to Php456,181 million as at December 31, 2020, an increase of Php47,444 million, or 12%, from Php408,737 million as at December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher interest-bearing financial liabilities.

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have any current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders’ equity, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

On August 5, 2014, the Board of Directors approved the amendment of our dividend policy, increasing the dividend payout rate to 75% from 70% of our core earnings per share as regular dividends. On August 2, 2016, the PLDT Board of Directors approved the amendment of our dividend policy, reducing our dividend payout rate to 60% of our core earnings per share as regular dividends. This was in view of the elevated capital expenditures to support the build-out of a resilient and reliable data network, lower EBITDA primarily due to higher subsidies to grow the data business and defend market share, and the resources required to support the acquisition of SMC’s telecommunications business. In declaring dividends, we take into consideration the interest of our shareholders, as well as our working capital, capital expenditures and debt servicing requirements. The retention of earnings may be necessary to meet the funding requirements of our business expansion and development programs. However, in the event that no investment opportunities arise, we may consider the option of returning additional cash to our shareholders in the form of special dividends of up to the balance of our core earnings or to undertake share buybacks. We were able to pay out approximately 100% of our core earnings for seven consecutive years from 2007 to 2013, approximately 90% of our core earnings for 2014, 75% of our core earnings for 2015, 60% of our core earnings for 2016, 2017 and 2018, and 60% of our telco core income for 2019 and 2020. The accumulated equity in the net earnings of our subsidiaries, which form part of our retained earnings, are not available for distribution unless realized in the form of dividends from such subsidiaries. Dividends are generally paid in Philippine pesos. In the case of shareholders residing outside the Philippines, PLDT’s transfer agent in Manila, Philippines, as the dividend-disbursing agent, converts the Philippine peso dividends into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate and remits the dollar dividends abroad, net of any applicable withholding tax.
Our subsidiaries pay dividends subject to the requirements of applicable laws and regulations and availability of unrestricted retained earnings, without any restriction imposed by the terms of contractual agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the subsidiaries of PLDT may, at any time, declare and pay such dividends depending upon the results of operations and future projects and plans, the respective subsidiary’s earnings, cash flow, financial condition, capital investment requirements and other factors.
Consolidated cash dividend payments paid to shareholders amounted to Php17,712 million, Php16,721 million, and Php15,592 million as at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Our outstanding consolidated commercial commitments, in the form of letters of credit, amounted to nil as at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Inflation can be a significant factor in the Philippine economy, and we are continually seeking ways to minimize its impact. The average inflation rate in the Philippines for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 4.5% and 2.6%, respectively. We expect inflation to be on the upper band or even breach the 2% to 4% target range of the BSP given the increase in oil prices brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

In December 2019, an outbreak of the disease COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”), later resulting in millions of confirmed cases and hundreds of thousands of fatalities globally, with thousands of confirmed cases and more than a thousand fatalities in the Philippines. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Different variants of COVID-19 have also emerged and reported in many countries around the world. In August 2021, the Delta variant of COVID-19, which has a shorter incubation period became the more dominant variant in the Philippines. In January 2022, the Philippine health ministry confirmed the local spread of the Omicron variant around the capital region. The Omicron variant spreads more easily than the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the Delta variant, although it is believed that the Omicron infection generally causes less severe disease than infection with prior variants. As at the date of this report, the COVID-19 disease and the different COVID-19 variants have continued to spread globally and remain to be categorized as a global pandemic.
Governments and health authorities around the world have imposed sweeping measures designed to contain the pandemic, including, among others, travel restrictions, border closures, curfews, quarantines, cancellations of gatherings and events and closures of universities, schools, restaurants, stores and other business. The economic repercussions of the pandemic and the efforts around the world to contain it have been severe, and include reduced global trade, lower industrial production, broad reductions in general consumption and economic activity and major disruptions to international travel and global air traffic.
On March 8, 2020, Presidential Proclamation No. 922 was issued declaring a State of Public Health Emergency throughout the Philippines due to COVID-19. In a move to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 12, 2020, the Office of the President of the Philippines issued a memorandum directive to impose stringent social distancing measures in the National Capital Region (“NCR”) effective March 15, 2020. On March 16, 2020, Presidential Proclamation No. 929 was issued, declaring a State of Calamity throughout the Philippines for a period of six months from March 17, 2020 (at midnight), unless earlier lifted or extended as circumstances may warrant, and imposed an enhanced community quarantine (“ECQ”) throughout the island of Luzon until April 12, 2020, unless earlier lifted or extended as circumstances may warrant. On March 24, 2020, Republic Act No. 11469, otherwise known as the “Bayanihan to Heal As One Act”, was signed into law, declaring a state of national emergency over the entire country, and authorizing the President of the Philippines to exercise certain powers necessary to address the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 7, 2020, the Office of the President of the Philippines released a memorandum extending the ECQ over the entire Luzon island until April 30, 2020. On May 1, 2020, the Government further extended the ECQ over, among others, certain portions of Luzon, including Metro Manila, until May 15, 2020, while easing restrictions in other parts of the country. On May 11, 2020, the Inter-Agency Task Force of Emerging Infectious Disease (“IATF”) placed high-risk LGUs under modified ECQ (“MECQ”) from May 16, 2020 until May 31, 2020, where certain industries were allowed to operate under strict compliance with minimum safety standards and protocols. On May 27, 2020, the IATF reclassified various provinces, highly urbanized cities and independent component cities depending on the risk-level. Meanwhile, on May 28, 2020, the Government placed Metro Manila under general community quarantine (“GCQ”), allowing for the partial reopening of certain businesses and public transportation while continuing to limit general movements.
Pursuant to the declaration of the President on August 2, 2020, the NCR and the provinces of Laguna, Cavite, Rizal and Bulacan were placed under MECQ from August 4, 2020 until August 18, 2020. On August 17, 2020, the President placed Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Rizal, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Quezon Province, Iloilo City, Cebu City, Lapu- Lapu City, Mandaue City, Talisay City, the municipalities of Minglanilla and Consolacion in Cebu under GCQ. The rest of the country was placed under Modified GCQ (“MGCQ”) effective August 19, 2020. The period of GCQ for Metro Manila was extended until November 30, 2020. On December 1, 2020, by the order of the President, the Executive Secretary issued a Memorandum advising that the President, taking into consideration the recommendations of the IATF, had approved the community quarantine classification of Provinces, Highly Urbanized Cities (“HUCs”), and Independent Component Cities from December 1 to 31, 2020 as indicated therein. Under said Memorandum, all HUCs of the NCR, the Municipality of Pateros, Batangas, Iloilo City, Tacloban City, Iligan City, Lanao del Sur Province, Davao City and Davao del Norte Province were placed under GCQ while the rest of the areas listed thereunder were placed under MGCQ without prejudice to the declaration of localized ECQ in critical areas.
On September 16, 2020, Presidential Proclamation No. 1021 was issued, extending the State of Calamity throughout the Philippines due to COVID-19 for a period of one year effective from September 13, 2020 to September 12, 2021, unless lifted earlier or extended as circumstances may warrant. On September 3, 2021, the IATF approved the shift in the policy in classifying provinces, HUC, and ICCs for purposes of community quarantine, wherein the new classification framework focuses on the imposition of granular lockdown measures based on an alert-level system (alert level 1 to 4), with each alert level imposing restrictions only on identified high-risk activities. The NCR was
designated as the pilot area of implementation, effective September 16, 2021. Effective October 20, 2021, the pilot area of implementation of the alert level systems was expanded to selected provinces, HUCs and ICCs outside of NCR. On November 11, 2021, the IATF approved the nationwide implementation of the alert-level system.
These and other measures have affected and caused disruption to businesses and economic activities, and their impact on businesses continues to evolve. While the Development Budget Coordination Committee estimates that the Philippine economy will grow by 7% to 9% in 2022 and by 6% to 7% for both 2023 and 2024, there is no assurance that the Philippine economy will grow in pace with this prediction.
The outbreak of COVID-19 and other adverse public health developments, such as the outbreak of avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, Zika virus and Ebola virus could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These may include temporary closures of our facilities or premises, hospitalizations or quarantine of our employees, delays or suspensions of supplies from our suppliers, especially those located in the PRC, disruptions or suspensions of our operational activities or labor shortages due to restrictions on our employees’ ability to travel, as well as delayed service delivery from our contractors. Although we have taken certain measures to try and minimize the negative effect of COVID-19 on our operations, there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient or that we will not be required to incur additional expense to address the effect of COVID-19 on our operations. See “Business — Recent Developments — Measures We Have Taken in Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic”.
As at December 31, 2021, we have incurred additional expenses relating to the purchase of protective equipment for our employees, the disinfection and reconfiguration of company premises, hospitalization and medical expenses for our employees covered by our medical benefits program, the provision of shuttle services for employees with no private transport and donations to various non-profit institutions, among others. In addition, we reconfigured our network to adjust for geographical and usage shifts during the pandemic. In 2021, total expenses related to our COVID-19 measures amounted to Php942 million.
While we were not significantly affected by COVID-19 in 2021 and have benefited from the increased demand for our wireless and fixed line products and services, particularly our data and broadband offers, as people forced to stay at home during community quarantines adopted web-based collaboration tools, distance learning, online shopping, e- payment and e-health services, among others, we cannot predict whether this increase in business activity will continue after the end of the pandemic.
In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it brings globally, we do not believe it is possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business, results of operations, and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and extent of the spread of COVID-19 both globally and within the countries in which we operate, the timeliness of vaccine procurement and inoculations, the prevalence of local, national and international travel restrictions, the impact on capital and financial markets and on the U.S. and global economies, foreign currencies exchange, and governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in these “Risks and Uncertainties”. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, will materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Increasing competition among existing telecommunications services providers, as well as competition from new competitors, could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects by, among other factors, forcing us to lower our tariffs, reducing or reversing the growth of our customer base and reducing usage of our services. Competition in the mobile telecommunications industry is particularly intense, with network coverage, quality of service, product offerings, and price dictating subscriber preference, while competition in the fixed line side, particularly in the fiber home broadband space, is now more active as well. Vital investments in capacity and coverage expansion may continue to increase our capital expenditures.
The mobile telecommunications industry has undergone a period of aggressive competition where mobile operators have attempted to grow market share, especially in light of a maturing voice and SMS market. Competition has since shifted to data, where competition remains active, but more focused on ability to provide good customer experience instead of price. Our principal mobile competitor, Globe, which began to participate more actively in the home broadband segment, via their fixed wireless home broadband service, has announced a strategic pivot to invest in and offer fiber home broadband. In addition, Converge ICT Solutions, Inc. (“Converge”), a pure fixed line broadband operator, has made inroads in the underpenetrated fiber home broadband space.
Meanwhile, Dito Telecommunity Corporation (“Dito”), the third major mobile player operated by a consortium consisting of Udenna Corporation, Chelsea Logistics Corporation and Infrastructure Holdings Corp. and China Telecommunications Corporation (together, the “NMP Consortium”) began its operations in June 2019 upon receiving a permit to operate after its chairman, Dennis Uy, was awarded the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (“CPCN”) from the NTC. In October 2019, Dito entered into agreements with Sky Cable and LCS Holdings, Inc. (“LCS Group”), pursuant to which Dito will lease the telecommunications towers that the LCS Group is building across different regions in the Philippines and use Sky Cable’s unused fiber-optic cables in Metro Manila.
Dito announced the launch of its commercial operations on March 8, 2021, with the initial launch limited to 15 cities in the Visayas and Mindanao area, and subsequently launched its services in the NCR (including Metro Manila) in May 2021. Dito is currently available in over 500 cities and municipalities in the country, with more than 4,100 towers, and 83,000 sales touchpoints nationwide. To level-up the subscriber experience, Dito rolled out next-generation features (Auto Pay and Advance Pay) offering discounts and data incentives for resubcscriptions. Dito reached seven million subscribers in March 2022, and are less than 300 towers away from covering 70% of the population.
Developments in law, regulations and/or Government initiatives may increase competition and cause us to lose customers. In 2017, as part of its push to encourage competition within the telecommunications industry, the Philippine Government introduced various measures to facilitate and enable the operations of new players, including a tower sharing policy, MNP, the removal of mobile interconnect charges and the lifting of foreign ownership restrictions on telecommunication companies. In 2019, Smart, Globe and Dito established a joint venture company, TCI, to enable number porting services in line with the Government’s MNP initiative, which was launched on September 30, 2021. TCI enables a customer to retain his/her mobile number when he/she moves from one mobile service provider to another or when he/she changes the type of mobile subscription from postpaid to prepaid or vice versa. This ability to retain one’s mobile number when switching between service providers further incentivizes our customer to switch away from us. The loss of customers due to such developments would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Meanwhile, as customers who switch away from us retain their mobile numbers, the mobile number prefixes which used to be exclusive to our subscribers will no longer be exclusive, and such loss may result in the dilution of the premium nature of our brand. We cannot guarantee you that in the future, there will not be similar changes in law, regulations or Government initiatives that may incentivize customers to switch away from us.
In the fixed line business, we are also seeing increased competition from Globe and Converge. Converge, in particular, has been aggressively expanding its network. In September 2019, it raised U.S.$250 million to help finance its plan to build a U.S.$1.8 billion nationwide internet backbone in addition to its plan to construct a domestic submarine cable with 20 landing stations across the Philippines. As of December 31, 2021, Converge has 1.7 million subscribers and has laid 103,000 kilometers of fiber backbone passing through 495 cities and municipalities throughout the country, and is set to invest around Php28 billion for further expansion. It has also more than double its net income due to aggressive penetration in Visayas and Mindanao. Globe, on the other hand, has indicated a shift in its home broadband strategy from offering fixed wireless to building and offering more fiber connections. Furthermore, Globe has also ventured into the data center space. To scale up capacity and capability in the data center space, Globe has entered into a joint venture partnership, with the potential to expand to 100-megwatts capacity in the medium to long term.
Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, network coverage, quality of service, price, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution
channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
To maintain our competitive posture in the face of increasing competition, we may need to match our competitors’ offers by lowering our price points and offering other incentives to prevent existing customers from switching, which may result in lower ARPUs and consequently, negatively impact our revenue. Furthermore, we may need to make additional investments in our network to further improve the customer experience in order to effectively compete with Globe and Dito. A loss of market share and increased costs to maintain our competitive posture will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that the number of providers of telecommunications services will not increase in the future or that competition for customers will not cause our mobile and fixed line subscribers to switch to other operators, or otherwise cause us to increase our marketing and capital expenditures, lose customers or reduce our rates, resulting in a reduction in our profitability.

The growing use of mobile data in the Philippines, coupled with the prevalence of OTT services and video conferencing applications, have negatively impacted our traditional revenue sources such as SMS and domestic calling services in recent years. We are also facing growing competition from providers offering services using alternative wireless technologies and IP-based networks, including efforts by the Philippine Government to roll-out its free WiFi services to selected areas within various municipalities in the country. Moreover, net settlement payments between PLDT and other foreign telecommunications carriers for origination and termination of international call traffic between the Philippines and other countries, which have been our predominant source of foreign currency revenues, have been declining in recent years and have diminishing contribution to our total service revenues.
While the trend of increasing mobile data usage has resulted in, and is expected to continue to have, a positive impact on our data revenues, there is no guarantee that such increase fully compensate for the decline in revenue from our traditional businesses. We may not be able to maintain and attract customers more effectively than our competitors. We will also need to invest in new infrastructure, systems and personnel to provide high quality services that accomodate increasing mobile data usage. As a result, our capital costs could increase as we phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and invest in new ones.
The advent of fifth-generation wireless (“5G”) is another potential disruptor. 5G is the latest evolution of cellular technology and is characterized by significantly higher speeds and low latency which will enable mobile users to download data at a much faster speed than previous generation technologies. 5G is also expected to anchor the IOT, which will allow users to connect with each other, as well as their homes, vehicles, public infrastructure and more. In order to make 5G technology available to our customers, we may need to obtain additional licenses or upgrade our networks, which may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures. As new technologies relating to 5G systems are developed, our equipment and infrastructure may need to be replaced or upgraded or we may need to rebuild our network, in whole or in part. If we are unable to acquire such licenses or upgrade such systems, on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to implement the 5G technology in a timely manner or at all, which in turn may negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and/or maintain our existing customer base.
We have started rolling out 5G radios in our base stations which are able to support customers’ 5G handsets. We are also conducting pilot tests of 5G equipment from several equipment vendors as standards for 5G technology continue to evolve. We are dependent on the availability of 5G network equipment and software, as well as 5G-capable devices such as handsets and modems before we can roll out commercial services and generate revenues. A delay in the release of reasonably-priced 5G handsets could negatively impact the mass acceptance of 5G services among our customers and our ability to monetize these investments, which in turn could adversely affect our growth prospects. Furthermore, a 5G rollout by other operators would introduce another area of competition and could consequently impact our business.
We may not be able to accurately predict further technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. We can neither assure you that we would be able to adopt or successfully implement new technologies and services nor assure you that future technological changes will not adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

We believe that our reputation and brands in the industry are crucial to the success of our business. To maintain and enhance our reputation and brands, we must continue providing relevant products and services, combined with the best customer experience, such that we not only maintain our current customer base but also attract new subscribers as well. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining and improving our brands, our business, financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected.

We have entered into a number of outsourcing agreements with technology vendors covering key operations in order to improve efficiencies and maximize knowledge transfer. These arrangements may disrupt existing operations and result in resistance among employees. Furthermore, any delays in implementation or failure to bring about the desired results will hamper our ability to meet our medium-term targets.
In particular, as part of our extensive capital expenditures program to overhaul our fixed and wireless networks infrastructure and our IT systems, we have entered into agreements with Amdocs Philippines, Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (“Huawei”), to upgrade and modernize a significant portion of our IT infrastructure. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to accomplish this transformation in a timely fashion, or at all, or in the manner intended. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that such transformation will not result in service disruptions, network outages or encounter other issues that may detrimentally affect consumer experience. This may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Due to our reliance on third party vendors, our business operations may be negatively impacted by any adverse changes in import policies, including increases in import duties and tariffs, or any embargo on imports from countries from which our vendors supply. In particular, trade tensions between the United States and major trading partners, including particularly with China, continue to escalate following the introduction of a series of tariff measures by the United States and/or its trading partners. Any further changes in the United States’ global trade policy against its trading partners, including tightening regulatory restrictions, industry specific quotas, tariffs, non-tariff barriers and taxes may have an adverse effect on our ability to procure the requisite components or services from suppliers located in the United States and/or its trading partners. For example, Huawei and its designated affiliates have been placed on the Entity List, an export control-related list, and Huawei has been designated as a “Communist Chinese military company” by the government of the United States, and the government of the United States has banned a broad array of American companies from utilizing information and communications technology supplied by Huawei. Any additional export restrictions imposed by the United States against Huawei and its designated entities, as well as any damage to Huawei’s image or reputation could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. Thus, we continue to monitor developments involving U. S. – China relations that may impact Huawei’s ability to operate. For example, we note that some countries and telecommunications service providers have banned or limited the use of Huawei’s technologies for various reasons. We have factored in such developments in our planning and decision-making with respect to our operation with Huawei, and will continue to do so.
Our business relies heavily as well on third party vendors, some of whom may encounter financial difficulties or consolidate with other vendors. This may result in a shrinking of the already limited pool of qualified vendors which may in turn, materially impact the third party vendors’ ability to fulfill their obligations and thereby impact our operations. The limited number of vendors may also result in our dependence on a single vendor to provide critical services.
Our ability to generate revenues could be disrupted if our suppliers are no longer able or willing to supply us. In the event that any of our suppliers cannot or will not provide us with the required products, we may be forced to find alternative supplies. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain our products or products of a similar quality from alternate suppliers, in part or at all. Failure to acquire alternative suppliers will disrupt our operations and hinder our ability to generate revenues.

The majority of our total revenues are currently derived from the provision of mobile services to customers in the Philippines. As a result, we depend on the continued development and growth of the mobile telecommunications industry in the Philippines. We believe the mobile penetration rate in the country, however, reached approximately 145% as at December 31, 2021, based on the number of SIM cards issued, and the industry may well be considered mature insofar as services such as SMS and domestic voice are concerned.
Data has emerged as the key driver for revenues. However, further growth of the market depends on many factors beyond our control, including the continued introduction of new and enhanced mobile devices, the price levels of mobile handsets, consumer tastes and preferences, alternative means of access, and the amount of disposable income of existing and potential subscribers. Any economic, technological or other developments resulting in a reduction in demand for mobile services or otherwise causing the Philippine mobile telecommunications industry to stop growing or slow down its growth, could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

In February 2022, the Philippine Congress approved the proposed amendments to the Public Service Act, which no longer considers telecommunication companies as “public utilities” but as “public service with critical infrastructure”. Under such amendments, telecommunication companies would no longer be subject to the 40% foreign ownership restriction under the Constitution, subject to reciprocity rules. While such an amendment would increase our access to foreign capital, it may also allow foreign nationals to make significant investments in other telco operators that can compete with us. The bill proposing amendments to the Public Service Act was signed by the President on March 21, 2022.
While we believe that PLDT is still in compliance with the requirements of the Constitution as of the date of this report, we cannot assure you that subsequent changes in law or additional litigation would not result in a different conclusion. Moreover, the required implementing rules to the amendments have not yet been released by the pertinent government agency on this matter and the details and impacts of such amendments on our business and the telco industry in general remains uncertain.

We operate our business under franchises, each of which is subject to amendment, termination or repeal by the Philippine Congress, and to various provisional authorities and CPCNs, which have been granted by the NTC and will expire between now and 2028. Some of our CPCNs and provisional authorities have already expired, but applications for the renewal of such CPCNs and provisional authorities were filed prior to their expiry. Under the Philippine Revised Administrative Code of 1987 and the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018, CPCNs and provisional authorities for which renewal applications have been filed are deemed effective until the applications for renewal are finally decided upon by the NTC. Although we have filed applications for the extension of these CPCNs and provisional authorities, we cannot assure you that the NTC will grant the applications for renewal. Failure to renew CPCNs can materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct the essential functions of our business, and therefore adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

The Philippine Congress may revoke, or the Solicitor General of the Philippines may file a quo warranto case against Smart and DMPI to revoke, the franchise of Smart and DMPI for their failure to comply with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 7925, which requires a telecommunications entity providing regulated services to make a public offering of at least 30% of its aggregate common stocks. See Item 1. “Description of Business – Material Effects of Regulation on our Business” for further discussions. However, on May 19, 2017, Republic Act No. 10926 took effect and effectively extended the legislative franchise of Smart. The law contains a provision which provides an exemption from such public listing requirement if the grantee is wholly-owned by a publicly listed company with at least 30% of its authorized capital stock is publicly listed. As Smart is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PLDT, a publicly listed company, Smart is not required to offer any of its shares to the public under Republic Act No. 7925.
Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that none of our franchises, permits or licenses will not be revoked in the future. Any such revocations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or prospects.

The NTC regulates the rates we are permitted to charge for services that have not yet been deregulated, such as local exchange services and is responsible for granting long-term license called a CPCN. PLDT has obtained CPCNs for its international gateway facility, local exchange carrier, cellular mobile telephone services and interexchange carrier services. While CPCNs are typically co-terminus with the term of a public utility’s franchise, the NTC may amend certain terms of a CPCN, or revoke a CPCN for cause, subject to due process procedures. The exercise of regulatory power by regulators, including monetary regulators, may be subject to review by the courts upon the filing of appropriate actions by the affected parties.
We cannot assure you that the NTC will not impose additional obligations on us that could lead to the revocation of our licenses if not adhered to and/or to the reduction of our total revenues or profitability. The NTC could amend applicable regulations or implement additional guidelines governing our interconnection with other telecommunications companies or the rates and terms upon which we provide services to our customers. In addition, any future expansions in our services, particularly in our mobile services, could subject us to additional conditions in the granting of provisional authorities by the NTC and to increased regulatory scrutiny, which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and prospects. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could impose substantial costs on us, cause interruptions or considerable delays in the provision, development or expansion of our services, or materially reduce our revenues and profitability. There is no assurance that the regulatory environment will support increases in our business and financial activity.
We are subject to a number of national and local taxes, and regulatory fees imposed by LGUs through their respective ordinances. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to new, increased and/or additional taxes or that we would be able to pass on such additional expenses to our customers. See Note 27 – Provisions and Contingencies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 7. “Financial Statements” for further discussion.
Moreover, we are subject to antitrust laws and regulations. The Republic Act No. 10667 (the “Philippine Competition Act”) came into effect on August 8, 2015 and prohibits practices that restrict market competition through anti-competitive agreements or the abuse of a dominant position. The Act also requires parties to provide notification and obtain clearance for certain mergers and acquisitions. Violators may be subject to administrative and criminal penalties. While our business practices have not in the past been found to have violated any antitrust laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that any new or existing governmental regulators will not, in the future, take the position that our current or past business practices have an anti-competitive effect on the Philippine telecommunications industry.
In particular, PLDT is currently involved in a litigation with the Philippine Competition Commission (the “PCC”), relating to PLDT’s investments in Vega Telecom Inc., Bow Arken Holdings Company and Brightshare Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the “SMC Transactions”). Although the Court of Appeals (the “CA”), among other things, compelled the PCC to recognize the SMC Transactions as having been deemed to be approved by operation of law, the CA held that the deemed approved status of the SMC Transactions does not, however, remove the power of the PCC to conduct post-acquisition review to ensure that no anti-competitive conduct was committed by the parties. The CA’s decision is on appeal with the Supreme Court and is not final and executory. An adverse judgment could materially and adversely affect our business and outlook. See Note 11 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures – In the Matter of the Petition against the PCC to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 7. “Financial Statements” for further discussion.
No assurance can be given that the regulatory environment in the Philippines will remain consistent or open. Current or future policies may affect our business and operations.

Legislations such as Republic Act No. 10173 and its implementing rules and regulations (the “Data Privacy Act”) aim to protect individual privacy. The rules apply to the processing of personal data in the public and private sectors, as well as to acts done or practices engaged in, in and outside of the Philippines under certain conditions. In 2021, the NPC has pivoted towards more enforcement actions as more privacy violations come to light and SMS phishing scams become more prevalent. Personal data breaches and other controversies relating to the unauthorized processing of personal data both within the Philippines and abroad continue to be a concern for consumers. Provisions in the Data Privacy Act on the Rights of Data Subjects and the NTC issuances under Memorandum Circular No. 05-07-2016 and NTC Memorandum Circular No. 05-06-2007 on the rights of the subscriber on record to their data and call data records highlight PLDT’s statutory obligation to be able to furnish complete and correct data to its users upon their request. These developments lead to an increased impetus on PLDT’s part to not only ensure compliance with the Data Privacy Act and similar laws, rules and regulations but also to meet industry best practices and customer expectations on data protection.
Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to make effective modifications to our policies, or to comply with any privacy, data-retention or data-protection-related laws, regulations, orders or industry self-regulatory principles, including the Data Privacy Act, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, loss of user confidence, damage to the PLDT brands, or the loss of users or advertising partners, any of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, various foreign legislative or regulatory bodies continue to enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data-retention and data-protection issues, including laws or regulations mandating disclosure to domestic or international law enforcement bodies, which could adversely impact our results of operations, businesses, brand or reputation with users. For instance, in May 2018, the General Data Protection came into force in the European Union and European Economic Area countries. In the United States, more and more states are adopting their own privacy and data protection legislation. Transfers of personal data across jurisdictions also continue to be a concern. For instance, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union in the case, Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Ltd, Maximilian Schrems and intervening parties, Case C-311/18 (also known as “Schrems II”) on the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield, indicate that prevailing arrangements on international data transfers may be subject to change as a result of court decisions in different jurisdictions. In the Philippines, proposed amendments to the Data Privacy Act have been filed with the
Congress of the Philippines. In general, the amendments focus on a review of the penalties for criminal offenses, as well as the authority of the NPC to levy fines for administrative offences. Since stakeholders,
including telecommunications service providers, have significant interest in these amendments, it is likely that the amendments will only be approved by the Philippine Congress after a lengthy period of solicitation of public opinion and discussion.
The interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data retention laws and regulations are often uncertain as these are highly dependent on the local context and culture and they can also be impacted by changes in technology. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices, complicating long-term business planning decisions. If privacy, data protection or data retention laws are interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current policies and practices we may be fined or ordered to change our business practices in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices or operating platforms in a manner adverse to our business.

We possess a substantial amount of personal information of our customers. In the event an information leak or cyber security breach occurs, whether on our end or on the part of our contractors and service providers, we may be subject to penalties under the Data Privacy Act, our credibility and corporate image may be significantly damaged and we may experience an increase in cancellations of customer contracts and a slower increase in additional subscriptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Despite having adopted stringent policies on employee sanctions to deter employee non-compliance of the Data Privacy Act, in 2021, the PLDT Group had four personal data breaches that met the Data Privacy Act’s requisites for mandatory reporting to the NPC and notice to affected data subjects. The reported incidents resulted primarily from failure of PLDT personnel to follow PLDT’s data privacy and information security policies. While the PLDT Group periodically conducts compliance audits and regularly holds privacy and information security training and awareness campaigns, it cannot guarantee that similar personal data breaches resulting from failure of personnel to comply with PLDT policies will not occur in the future. Such breaches could result in litigation and/or regulatory actions and penalties against us, and adversely impact on our business operations and financial conditions.

Regulators have been increasing their focus on online and mobile payment services, and recent regulatory and other developments could reduce the convenience or utility of our payment services for users. Governmental regulation of certain aspects of mobile payment systems under which PLDT operates could result in obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products that we may offer to consumers, the payment card systems that link to our mobile payments systems, the jurisdictions in which our payment services or apps may be used, and higher costs, such as fees charged by banks to process funds through our mobile payments systems. Such obligations and restrictions could be further increased as more jurisdictions regulate payment systems. Moreover, if this regulation is used to provide resources or preferential treatment or protection to selected payments and processing providers, we could be displaced, prevented or substantially restricted from participating in particular geographies.

The available radio frequency spectrum is one of the principal limitations on a wireless network’s capacity, and there are limitations in the spectrum and facilities available to us to provide our services. Our future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer relevant content and data services and a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support such services. Improvements in our service depend on many factors, including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum.
In order to acquire spectrum, a duly enfranchised mobile network operator (“MNO”) must apply and secure a provisional authority from the NTC to render a specific telecommunications service through its franchise. After a hearing, the NTC then grants a provisional authority to the MNO, which specifies the period, service area and essential frequencies for delivering the telecommunications service assigned to the MNO. Moreover, spectrum users’ fees are charged by the NTC for use of the allocated spectrum.

Our competitiveness may decline if we cannot obtain the necessary or optimal allocation of spectrum from the Philippine Government. If the Philippine Government does not fairly allocate spectrums to wireless providers in general, revokes the spectrum previously granted to us, or if we fail to acquire the necessary amount of spectrum or deploy the services that customers desire on a timely basis without burdensome conditions or at adequate cost while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers, and therefore maintain and improve our operating margins, could be materially and adversely affected.

If a sufficient number of mobile service providers does not adopt the technologies and frequency bands that are compatible with ours, if mobile service providers switch to other technologies or frequency bands, or if there is a delay in the introduction and expansion of compatible technologies and frequency bands, we may not be able to offer international roaming or other international services as expected, which may adversely affect our business.

As growth slows or reverses in our traditional fixed line and mobile businesses, and as part of our strategy to grow other business segments, we make acquisitions and investments in companies or businesses to enter new businesses or defend our existing markets. The success of our acquisitions and investments depends on a number of factors, such as:
our ability to identify suitable opportunities for investment or acquisition;
our ability to reach an acquisition or investment agreement on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all;
the extent to which we are able to influence or exercise control over the acquired or investee company;
the compatibility of the economic, business or other strategic objectives and goals of the acquired or investee company with those of the PLDT Group, as well as the ability to execute the identified strategies in order to generate fair returns on the investment; and
our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company or business with our existing businesses.
Any of our contemplated acquisitions and investments may not be consummated due to reasons or factors beyond our control. Even if any contemplated acquisitions and investments are consummated, we may not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and investments and we cannot assure you that the consummation of such acquisitions and investments will not result in losses for a prolonged period of time. Moreover, if we are unsuccessful in our contemplated acquisitions and investments, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy to maintain or grow certain of our businesses and our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.

Given the nature of our business and our foray into the digital business, we have made investments in various start-up companies. For example, we hold an investment in VIH, an important player in the financial technology space and an integral part of our digital payments ecosystem. In accordance with PAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, we account for our investment in VIH using the equity method, whereby we recognize our proportionate share of VIH’s losses, which amount to Php2,237 million and Php2,392 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Credit ratings and the value of this investment and similar investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, foreign exchange rates, or other factors. As a result, our investments could decline and result in a material impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

On October 5, 2020, PLDT signed an agreement for the sale of Smart’s headquarters, which also included a lease-back agreement with the buyer, pursuant to which we are permitted to continue occupying the building for no more than five years. If we fail to find a suitable alternative office space or adopt an acceptable office set-up (e. g., work from home or hybrid arrangements) prior to the expiration of the lease-back agreement, we may need to negotiate the extension of the lease-back agreement. There is no assurance that we will be able to extend the lease-back agreement on reasonable terms, or at all. Any relocations could disrupt our business operations. Any of the foregoing events could materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial conditions.

Our business requires the regular installation of new telecommunications transmission and other facilities and equipment, and the regular maintenance of such facilities and equipment, which are continually being undertaken. The installation and maintenance of these facilities and equipment are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, such as:
shortages of equipment, materials and labor;
delays in the issuance of national and local government building permits;
work stoppages and labor disputes;
interruptions resulting from man-made events (e.g., sabotage), outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, inclement weather and other natural disasters;
rapid technological obsolescence;
inability of vendors and/or suppliers to deliver on commitments;
unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems; and
unanticipated cost increases.
Any of these factors could give rise to delays or cost overruns in the installation of new facilities or equipment or prevent us from deploying our networks and properly maintaining the equipment used in our networks, and hence affect our ability to maintain existing services and roll-out new services, for example, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We need to constantly upgrade our cyber security capabilities to support our business needs. We depend on information and digital services to run our business and deliver value. Our Company faces the following challenges in an era of connectivity, digital identity, decentralized decisions, information monetization, transparency, and variable trust:
An increase in the variety of products and services that we provide to our customers (e.g. customer premise equipment, systems, devices, IoT, data and their dynamic relationships) exposes relevance issues as well as scalability issues in our existing security control solutions;
Our existing deterrence measures against cyber security breaches may become less effective. For instance, defensible gates and impermeable walls that are designed to secure our service and information infrastructure have become less effective. While such tools and measures make it difficult to breach our system, these tools may not stop breaches altogether;
The infrastructure underpinning the digitalization of consumer and enterprise services has become more complex. In order to enhance work efficiency, we allow our employees to work away from the office. This means giving employees cloud access to collaboration platforms and controlled remote access to pre-identified operational systems on their personal devices, such as mobile phones and workstations. Given the large number of points of access to our internal network, we need to constantly improve our cyber infrastructure and implement more sophisticated tools to protect it from attacks, as well as raise employee awareness and vigilance regarding cyber risks;
The consequences of a cyber security breach could be severe. Breaches resulting in leakage of our Company’s confidential commercial and/or personal information may result in irreparable damage to our reputation and brand. Moreover, leakage of sensitive personal information could, in some cases, result in a threat to personal safety, as well as legal and/or regulatory liability;
Perpetrators are adopting more sophisticated technologies in their attempts to breach our defensive security measures. We see a growing number of automated computer programs being used in initiating attacks; and
While encrypted internet traffic protects private information, it inadvertently hampers cyber protection efforts. Perpetrators could abuse encrypted communication tools and use them in their efforts to breach into our systems, with less risk of such efforts being discovered by cyber security measures.
Our Cyber Security Operations Group (“CSOG”) continues to address cyber threats and attacks. In 2021, we blocked 5.7 billion access to malicious sites by our customers and employees; detected and prevented 46,000 high- risk endpoint activities; responded to more than 5.7 billion incidents in our corporate structure; mitigated 3,500 DDoS attacks, blocked 10.4 million attacks to our corporate websites; blocked unauthorized access from 4,400 unmanaged devices, blocked 154,000 URLs linked to CSAEM and secured 338.2 million business emails, 193.8 million of which contained malicious threats like spam emails, viruses, malware and invalid recipients.
In addition to protecting our internal infrastructure and platforms, our CSOG continues to safeguard our subscriber base by preventing it from falling victim to cyberattacks, such as malware and phishing. With the upsurge in demand for bandwidth and digital services during the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a corresponding increase in cyber threat activities, mainly in the form of phishing emails, malware websites and download ransomware, all of which use information regarding COVID-19 as a bait.
On their own and taken as a whole, these incidents did not cause any material financial, legal, reputational or regulatory impact to the Company, nor did they cause any material disruptions to our business operations. However, as cyberattacks have become a persistent global and domestic threat, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully prevent all forms of cyber intrusions. Any successful attack on our infrastructure could result in legal and/or regulatory liabilities, disruptions to our business operations, damage to our reputation, and financial losses. While we maintain cyber insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain.

The effects of, and any damage caused by, exposure to an electromagnetic field remain the subject of careful evaluations by the international scientific community. We cannot rule out the possibility that exposure to electromagnetic fields or other emissions originating from mobile handsets will not be identified as a health risk in the future. Our mobile business may be harmed as a result of any future alleged, or actual, health risk or the perception of any health risk, which could result in our inability to secure permits to install telecom equipment, a lower number of customers, reduced usage per customer or even potential consumer liability.

Theft of telecommunication cables, major equipment failures, and man-made events, such as terrorist acts or other similar or related contingencies, could adversely affect our wired and wireless networks, including telephone switching offices, microwave links, third-party-owned local and long-distance networks on which we rely, our cell sites or other equipment, our customer account support and information systems, or our employee and business records, and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks and other events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may be insufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and additional expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.

Our business operations may not be insulated from the effects of international conflicts. The occurence of an international conflict or an escalation in the intensity of such conflict may affect the global economy, including impacting the supply and prices of energy, food and other critical commodities. In addition, it may affect the global supply chain, consequently affecting vendor delivery. It may also impact the capital and financial markets, foreign currencies exchange, investments, and governmental or regulatory orders, which in turn, may impact our business.

Climate change poses a number of potential risks for telecommunications operators like us, from both a physical and regulatory perspective. The ongoing global climate change may exacerbate the severity and frequency of natural disasters. The rising intensity and frequency of storms, heatwaves and earthquakes could increase the likelihood of damages to our infrastructure and failures of our wired and wireless networks caused by such natural disasters. Should severe natural disasters occur in quick succession, we may not have sufficient resources to repair and restore our infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner. Furthermore, climate change and severe weather conditions could also affect and disrupt our supply chain, resulting in delays in the delivery of our supplies. The increase in the likelihood of damages to our infrastructure and disruptions in our supply chain as a result of natural disasters could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
In light of heightened awareness on climate change globally, the Philippine Government could introduce new and more stringent environmental legislation and regulations. If such legislation or regulations are enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply. We cannot guarantee that we will at all times be in compliance with any new environmental legislation and regulations. The failure to comply with new environmental legislation and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial conditions.

Our projects under development and the continued maintenance and improvement of our networks and services, including Smart’s projects, networks, platforms and services, require substantial ongoing capital investment. Our consolidated capital expenditures, reflecting gross additions to property and equipment totaled Php88,983 million, Php71,904 million and Php72,871 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We currently estimate that our consolidated capital expenditures in 2022 will be between Php76 billion to Php80 billion. In 2022, we will prioritize projects that support the growing demand from our customers, enhance our ability to deliver superior customer experience, and help corporate customers revive their businesses.
Future strategic initiatives could require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures. We may be required to finance a portion of our future capital expenditures from external financing sources, some of which have not yet been fully arranged. There can be no assurance that financing for new projects will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot complete our development programs or other capital projects on time due to our failure to obtain the required financing, our growth, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, if we are unable to monetize our investments and generate the expected revenues, our cash flows and gearing may be negatively impacted.

A substantial portion of our capital expenditures, a portion of our indebtedness and related interest expense and a portion of our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, whereas most of our revenues are denominated in Philippine pesos with only 19% of our revenues denominated in U.S. dollars.
A depreciation of the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar would increase the amount of our U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations, capital expenditures, and operating and interest expenses in Philippine peso terms. In the event that the Philippine peso depreciates against the U.S. dollar, we may be unable to generate enough funds through operations and other means to offset the resulting increase in our obligations in Philippine peso terms. Moreover, a depreciation of the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar may result in our recognition of significant foreign exchange losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. A depreciation of the Philippine peso could also cause us not to be in compliance with the financial covenants imposed on us by our lenders under certain loan agreements and other indebtedness. Further, fluctuations in the Philippine peso value and of interest rates impact the mark-to-market gains/losses of certain of our financial debt instruments, which were designated as non-hedged items.
The Philippine peso has been subject to significant depreciation in recent years with the Philippine peso depreciated by 24% from a high of Php41.08 for 2012 to Php50.97 as at December 31, 2021 and further depreciated to Php51.385 as at February 28, 2022. We cannot assure you that the Philippine peso will not depreciate further and be subject to significant fluctuations going forward, due to a range of factors, including:
political and economic developments affecting the Philippines, including the level of remittances from overseas Filipino workers;
global economic and financial trends;
the volatility of emerging market currencies;
any interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States and/or the BSP; and
higher demand for U.S. dollars by both banks and domestic businesses to service their maturing U.S. dollar obligations or foreign exchange traders including banks covering their short U.S. dollar positions, among others.

Our existing debt instruments contain covenants which, among other things, require PLDT to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial tests, calculated on the basis of PFRS at relevant measurement dates, principally at the end of each quarter period. In addition, PLDT’s bonds contain covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions.
Our indebtedness and the requirements and limitations imposed by our debt covenants could have important consequences. For example, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements.
The principal factors that could negatively affect our ability to comply with these financial ratio covenants and other financial tests are the poor operating performance of PLDT and its subsidiaries, the depreciation of the Philippine peso relative to the U.S. dollar, the impairment or similar charges in respect of investments or other long-lived assets that may be recognized by PLDT and its subsidiaries, and increases in our interest expense. Interest expense may increase as a result of various factors including the issuance of new debt, the refinancing of lower cost indebtedness by higher cost indebtedness, the depreciation of the Philippine peso relative to the U.S. dollar, the lowering of PLDT’s credit ratings or the credit ratings of the Philippines, the increase in reference interest rates, and general market conditions. Of our total consolidated debts, approximately 16% was denominated in U.S. dollars as at December 31, 2021. Considering our consolidated hedges and dollar cash allocated for debt, the unhedged portion of our consolidated debt amounts was approximately 5%, as at December 31, 2021, therefore, the financial ratio and other tests are expected to be negatively affected by any weakening of the Philippine peso relative to the U.S. dollar.
If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our debt covenants, we may need to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. An inability to implement these measures successfully could result in a declaration of default and an acceleration of maturities of some or all of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

A significant part of our total revenues and cash flows from operating activities are derived from our subsidiaries, particularly Smart. Smart has significant internal cash requirements for debt service, capital expenditures and operating expenses and as a result, may be financially unable to pay any dividends to PLDT. Although Smart has been making dividend payments to PLDT regularly since December 2002, there can be no assurance that PLDT will continue to receive these dividends or other distributions, or otherwise be able to derive liquidity from Smart or any other subsidiary or investee in the future.
Creditors of our subsidiaries generally have priority claims over our subsidiaries’ assets and cash flows. We and our creditors will effectively be subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of our subsidiaries, except that we may be recognized as a creditor with respect to loans we have made to subsidiaries. If we are recognized as a creditor of a subsidiary, our claim will still be subordinated to any indebtedness secured by assets of the subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary otherwise deemed superior to the indebtedness we hold.
We may have difficulty meeting our debt payment obligations if we do not continue to receive cash dividends from our subsidiaries and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected as a result.

As at February 28, 2022, First Pacific and its Philippine affiliates (together, the “FP Parties”), NTT Communications and NTT DOCOMO and the JG Summit Group, collectively, beneficially own 57.2% in PLDT’s outstanding common stock (representing 33.8% of our overall voting stock).
Additionally, all of PLDT’s shares of voting preferred stock, which represent 41% of PLDT’s total outstanding shares of voting stock as at February 28, 2022, are owned by a single stockholder, BTF Holdings, Inc. (“BTFHI”).
The FP Parties, NTT Communications, NTT DOCOMO, JG Summit Group and/or BTFHI may exercise their respective voting rights over certain decisions and transactions in a manner that could be contrary to the interests of other shareholders or stakeholders in PLDT.

As at December 31, 2021, PLDT has three employee unions, representing in the aggregate 9,053, or 48%, of the employees of the PLDT Group. This unionized workforce could result in demands that may increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. For instance, PLDT experienced significant charges from its manpower rightsizing program in 2019, 2020 and 2021, mainly incurred in the fixed-line business. Each of our different employee groups require separate collective bargaining agreements. If PLDT and any of its unions are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or if PLDT were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, PLDT could be subject to collective bargaining deadlocks, strikes, work slowdowns or stoppages. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Additionally, on July 3, 2017, PLDT received a Compliance Order from the DOLE, in connection with the non-payment of statutorily required monetary benefits, including the 13th month pay by certain PLDT contractors to their employees, as well as the regularization of 7,344 contractor employees. On July 31, 2018, the CA promulgated a decision granting PLDT’s request for an injunction against the Compliance Order and remanded the case back to the DOLE for further proceedings regarding the computation of the monetary awards, which amounted to Php51.8 million according to the regularization orders, and the determination of employees engaged in installation, repair and maintenance work who must be regularized. On April 5, 2019, PLDT filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court that is now pending resolution. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Note 27 – Provisions and Contingencies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 7. “Financial Statements” for further discussion.
We cannot guarantee that PLDT or its subsidiaries will not be subject to similar proceedings or other labor-related regulatory activities, the results of which may have an adverse reputational and/or financial impact. While we believe that PLDT has a strong legal position in its pending labor cases, we note that labor tribunals are mandated to resolve cases in favor of employees in the case of any doubt.

Our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified key technical, development, sales, services and management personnel. The loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be costly and time consuming, could cause additional disruptions to our business and could be unsuccessful. We cannot guarantee the continued employment of any of the members of our senior leadership team, who may depart our Company for any number of reasons, such as other business opportunities, differing views on our strategic direction or other personal reasons. Any inability to attract, retain or motivate our personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects.

We are currently involved in various legal proceedings. Our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims have been developed in consultation with our counsel and is based upon our analysis of potential results. Our future financial performance could be materially affected by any adverse outcomes or by changes in our estimates or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings and assessments.
While PLDT believes that the positions it has taken in these cases have strong legal bases, the final outcome of these cases may prove to be different from its expectations. In addition, we cannot assure you that PLDT will not be involved in future litigation or other disputes, the results of which may materially and adversely impact its business and financial conditions.

Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including device financing, customer credit card, subscription or dealer fraud. If our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as customers, national retailers, dealers, and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

The Philippines has, from time to time, experienced political and military instability, including acts of political violence. In the last two decades, there has been political instability in the Philippines, including extra-judicial killings, alleged electoral fraud, impeachment proceedings against two former presidents, two chief justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, and public and military protests arising from alleged misconduct by the previous and current administrations. In addition, a number of officials of the Philippine Government are currently under investigation or have been indicted on corruption charges stemming from allegations of misuse of public funds, extortion, bribery or usurpation of authority.
In addition, the Philippines has also been subject to a number of terrorist attacks and the Armed Forces of the Philippines has been in conflict with groups which have been identified as being responsible for kidnapping and terrorist activities in the Philippines. In addition, bombings have taken place in the Philippines, mainly in cities in the southern part of the country. For example, in May 2017, the city of Marawi in Lanao del Sur, Mindanao, was assaulted by the Maute Group, terrorists who were inspired by pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Due to the clash between the Philippine Government forces and the terrorists and the risk of the armed conflict spilling over to other parts of Mindanao, martial law was declared in the entire island of Mindanao, Philippines. In October 2017, the city was declared liberated from the terrorists. Despite this, the Philippine Congress extended the imposition of martial law in Mindanao until the end of 2019, citing persistent threats of terrorism and rebellion. The martial law in Mindanao was lifted on January 1, 2020, however Mindanao remains under a state of emergency as a measure against potential terror threats and communist insurgency and to maintain peace and order in the region. An increase in the frequency, severity or geographic reach of these terrorist acts could destabilize the Philippines, and adversely affect the country’s economy. These armed conflict and terror attacks could lead to further injuries or deaths by civilians and members of the military, which could destabilize parts of the country and adversely affect the country’s economy. In addition, on July 3, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law R.A. No. 11479, or the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, which has drawn criticism from, and sparked protests by, various sectors because of its controversial provisions on warrantless arrests and its broad definition of terrorist acts, which may be used to target government critics. The said bill will pass into law upon approval by, or within 30 days of receipt upon inaction of, President Rodrigo Duterte.
Further, a national general election will be held on May 9, 2022 for various national and local positions, including the presidency. We cannot assure you that the political environment in the Philippines will be stable or that the current or the incoming administration will adopt economic policies that are conducive to sustained economic growth or which do not materially and adversely impact the current regulatory environment for the telecommunications and other companies. An unstable political or social environment in the Philippines could negatively affect the general economic conditions and business environment in the Philippines which, in turn, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial position and financial performance.

The Philippines, China and several Southeast Asian nations have been engaged in a series of long-standing territorial disputes arising from competing and overlapping claims over certain islands and features in the West Philippine Sea. China claims historic rights to nearly all of the West Philippine Sea based on its so-called “nine-dash line” and in recent years, dramatically expanded its military presence in the sea which has raised tension in the region among the claimant countries. In 2013, the Philippines became the first claimant country to file a case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the internal arbitration tribunal based at the Hague, Netherlands to legally challenge claims of China in the West Philippine Sea and to resolve the dispute under the principles of international law as provided for under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In July 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration rendered a decision stating that the Philippines has exclusive sovereign rights over the West Philippine Sea (in the South China Sea) and that the “nine-dash line” claim of China is invalid. The Philippine Government, under the Duterte administration, has taken action to de-escalate tensions concerning the territorial dispute with China.
There is no guarantee that the territorial dispute between the Philippines and other countries, including China, would end or that any existing tension will not escalate further, as China has taken steps to exercise control over the disputed territory. Should these territorial disputes continue or escalate further, the Philippines and its economy may be disrupted and our operations could be adversely affected as a result. In particular, further disputes between the Philippines and China may lead both countries to impose trade restrictions on the other’s imports. Any such impact from these disputes could adversely affect the Philippine economy, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and financial performance.

In general, Philippine residents may freely dispose of their foreign exchange receipts and foreign exchange may be freely sold and purchased outside the Philippine banking system. However, the Monetary Board of the BSP has statutory authority, with the approval of the President of the Philippines, during a foreign exchange crisis or in times of national emergency, to:
suspend temporarily or restrict sales of foreign exchange;
require licensing of foreign exchange transactions; or
require the delivery of foreign exchange to the BSP or its designee banks for the issuance and guarantee of foreign currency-denominated borrowings.
The Philippine Government has, in the past, instituted restrictions on the conversion of the Philippine peso into foreign currencies and the use of foreign exchange received by Philippine companies to pay foreign currency-denominated obligations.

We cannot assure you that foreign exchange controls will not be imposed in the future. If imposed, these restrictions could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain foreign currency to service our foreign currency obligations.

Historically, the Philippines’ sovereign debt has been rated non-investment grade by international credit rating agencies. However, in 2013, the Philippines’ credit ratings were upgraded to investment grade by Moody’s, (Baa3, stable) SP Global (BBB-, stable) and Fitch (BBB-, stable). Subsequently, Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch announced improvements in the Philippines’ credit ratings of Baa2, BBB+ and BBB, respectively. In May 2021, S&P affirmed its rating of BBB+, with stable outlook, with the expectation that the domestic economy will achieve a healthy economic recovery. In July 2020, Moody’s affirmed its rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook. In July 2021, Fitch affirmed its rating of BBB, but revised its outlook to ‘negative’ due to increasing risks to the credit profile from the impact of the pandemic and policy- marking for health response. 

The Philippine Government’s credit ratings directly affect companies domiciled in the Philippines as international credit rating agencies issue credit ratings by reference to that of the sovereign. No assurance can be given that Fitch, Moody’s, S&P, or any other international credit rating agency will not downgrade the credit ratings of the Philippine Government in the future and, therefore, Philippine companies, including PLDT. Any such downgrade could have a material adverse impact on the liquidity in the Philippine financial markets, on the ability of the Philippine Government and Philippine companies, including PLDT, to raise additional financing, and on the interest rates and other commercial terms at which such additional financing is available.
