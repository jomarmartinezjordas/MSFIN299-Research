AC_2020.txt,Please see discussion below on Operations of the segment under PFRS 5.
AC_2020.txt,B.
AC_2020.txt,The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly affected the operating results of certain subsidiaries and investees reflected in the consolidated income statement.
AC_2020.txt,"For the year ended December 2020, Ayala Land’s total revenues declined 43% to ₱96.3 billion and net income fell 74% to ₱8.7 billion due to Covid-19 as a result of lower sales bookings, lower construction completion from residential projects caused by community quarantine restrictions, limited malls operations during quarantine, and lower average hotel occupancy due to quarantine and travel bans until July 2020."
AC_2020.txt,Easing of these restrictions starting month of August allowed ALI to show improvements in operating results.
AC_2020.txt,"For IMI, similar government-mandated lockdowns in certain foreign countries and voluntary suspension in other sites, impacted on lower output."
AC_2020.txt,Moderating these restrictions at the onset of Q3 2020 onwards similarly allowed IMI to uplift revenues and bottom lines.
AC_2020.txt,The impact of pandemic is shown in the following key income statement accounts.
AC_2020.txt,"Sale of goods and rendering services – 27% decrease from ₱264,907 million to ₱193,622 million Decrease affected by ECQ: ALI (lower construction completion, residential segment bookings, rental waive and lower occupancy rates); and IMI’s and ACI’s lower revenues caused by lower customer demand and slowdown in operations."
AC_2020.txt,These downtrends were partly offset by partial recovery in Q3 2020 plus higher revenues due to consolidation of AC Energy’s ACEN and AC Health’s Generika and Healthway.
AC_2020.txt,"As a percentage to total revenue, this account is at 88% and 90% in December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively."

AC_2020.txt,"Cost of sales and services – 24% decrease from ₱189,983 million to ₱144,181 million
Decrease in account is aligned with the decline in revenues."
AC_2020.txt,"As a percentage to total costs and expenses, this account is at 82% and 86% in December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively."
AC_2020.txt,"Share in net profits of associates and joint ventures – 21% decrease from ₱22,344 million to ₱17,616 million

AC_2020.txt,"As a percentage to total revenue, this account is at 8% in December 31, 2020 and 2019."
AC_2020.txt,"Provision for income tax (current and deferred) – 63% decrease from ₱13,984 million to ₱5,239 million
Decrease due to lower net income of ALI for the year."
AC_2020.txt,"Income attributable to owners of the parent – 51% decrease from ₱35,279 million to ₱17,142 million
Decrease resulting from this year’s lower net income results of most of the investees particularly ALI, ACI, AC Infra, BPI and Globe as an effect of restricted operations and BHL’s provision for impairment; plus impact of last year’s AC Energy’s gain on sale of AA Thermal and AC’s gain on AC Education and iPeople merger."
AC_2020.txt,This is partly offset by the reversal of MWC remeasurement loss.
AC_2020.txt,"As a percentage to total net income, this account is at 59% and 84% in December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively."
AC_2020.txt,"Income attributable to non-controlling interests – 81% increase from ₱6,703 million to ₱12,129 million

AC_2020.txt,"Dividend and other income – 81% decrease from ₱32,411 million to ₱6,209 million
Decrease due to impact of last year’s AC Energy’s gain on sale of AA Thermal and AC’s gain on AC Education and iPeople merger, and current year’s fair value adjustments on BHL’s investments; partly offset by current year’s higher other income of AC Energy arising from investment gains, liquidated damages on delayed completion of GNPK plant and reversal of derivative losses and IMI’s gain on put options."
AC_2020.txt,Also includes GNPK’s other income accounts (see Note 25).
AC_2020.txt,"Interest and other financing charges – 25% increase from ₱22,410 million to ₱28,014 million
Increase coming from ALI, AC Energy and AYCFL as a result of higher debt balance level this year."
AC_2020.txt,The Group’s adoption of PFRS 16 also increased interest expense by ₱1.8 billion.
AC_2020.txt,"Operations of the segment under PFRS 5 – 132% increase from loss of ₱30,433 million to net income of ₱9,797 million
Includes the net income after tax of MWC less consolidation adjustments."
AC_2020.txt,Increase mainly due to decline in impairment provisions (with partial reversal of remeasurement loss this year) plus the impact of last year’s bill waiver and higher billed volume this year; partly offset by provisions on fair value adjustments of investment in AJVs and various exposures.
AC_2020.txt,"As required by PFRS5/ IFRS 5, the investment in MWC, which was reclassified as asset held for sale, should be subsequently re-measured to its fair market value (FMV) and the corresponding difference against carrying value (CV) be recognized as reversal of or additional loss."
AC_2020.txt,"In addition to the remeasurement loss taken up in December 2019, an amount of ₱1.79 billion (P1.63 billion net of tax) remeasurement loss was recognized in June 2020, which formed part of the GAE of operations of the segment under PFRS 5 in the consolidated income statement."
AC_2020.txt,"In December 2020, a partial reversal of remeasurement loss amounting to ₱6.59 billion (₱3.39 billion of which is attributable to the owners of the Parent Company) was booked which formed part of Other income of operations of the segment under PFRS 5 (Note 25)."
AC_2020.txt,The Philippines suffered a significant blow from the COVID-19 health crisis in 2020 as it endured a nationwide lockdown and a pronounced slowdown in international trade.
AC_2020.txt,"At the peak of the pandemic’s impact, the strictest form quarantine restrictions were imposed, limiting business activity and dampening consumer confidence."
AC_2020.txt,"However, as restrictions were gradually eased in the second half of the year, mobility and business confidence consequently recovered."
AC_2020.txt,"Ayala likewise saw a marked turnaround in demand and operations across its businesses, which continued to improve throughout the early months of 2021."
AC_2020.txt,"As the country enters a stage of recuperation, we see GDP growth in 2021 increasing by 6.8 percent coming from a 9.5 percent decline in 2020."
AC_2020.txt,"The last six months of the year saw a meaningful recovery in mobility, indicating that consumers have found a sense of normalcy in exiting the household while taking the necessary precautions."
AC_2020.txt,"Coupled with an eventual easing of transportation protocols and continued increase in digital consumption, we expect economic output to return to the 2019 level by 2022."
AC_2020.txt,"Should other risks such as another lockdown materialize however, the Philippines may find it difficult to for GDP to grow beyond the 6 percent mark."
AC_2020.txt,"Aside from consumption, two other pillars of the economy have remained strong – overseas remittances and BPO activity."
AC_2020.txt,"Despite massive layoffs and repatriations worldwide, remittances declined by only 0.8 percent to US$33 billion, comprising 9.2 percent of the country’s economic output."
AC_2020.txt,"Meanwhile, the BPO industry was quick to bounce back from just 50 percent productivity in April 2020 to 90 percent by July."
AC_2020.txt,Both drivers softened the blow of the pandemic to the Philippine economy and are likely to remain as solid contributors to economic output.
AC_2020.txt,"However, a risk factor is the Eurozone’s status as renewed lockdowns and a double-dip recession may put pressure on remittances."
AC_2020.txt,"Related to this, we see the Dollar-Peso rate depreciating to the 49 level in 2021 as the worldwide economies slowly reopen and US Dollar demand returns."
AC_2020.txt,Another important factor that supported the Philippines’ business environment in 2020 is the BSP Monetary Board’s move to slash the interest rate to an all-time low of 2.0 percent from 4.0 percent in the year.
AC_2020.txt,Local businesses found strength in the cheap funding environment as low interest rates allowed them to cover their working capital needs in the face of tight cashflows.
AC_2020.txt,"As quarantine measures continue to stay in place, we expect the Central Bank to maintain the interest rate at 2.0 percent."
AC_2020.txt,"Further cuts may be unlikely due to the threat of growing inflation, which has already risen to 3.5 percent in December 2020 and 4.2 percent the following month."
AC_2020.txt,Supply side factors such as rising oil prices and higher pork prices due to the African Swine Flu continue pose as risks in elevating inflation.
AC_2020.txt,"As such, we expect the print to increase to 3.1 percent in 2021 from 2.6 percent last year."
AC_2020.txt,"We also believe that in 2021, many companies will wish to move on the trends observed in 2020 more decisively."
AC_2020.txt,"Thus, we are likely to see the private sector step up capital expenditures to develop their digital and telecommunication assets, logistical capabilities, and factory and farm equipment as well."
AC_2020.txt,This has the potential to trickle down into employment and improve from the -8.7 percent decrease we saw in the fourth quarter of 2020.
AC_2020.txt,"Against this backdrop of developments, the Ayala group closely monitors key trends and potential risks in the global and domestic economies as well as in the industries where it operates."
AC_2020.txt,"That said, the Ayala group will continue executing in its investment programs and has allocated ₱196 billion in combined capital expenditure for 2021."
AC_2020.txt,Ayala maintains a healthy balance sheet with access to various funding options to meet requirements.
AC_2020.txt,"A robust risk management system allows the company to maximize opportunities for reinvention, and navigate the challenges faced by its business units."
