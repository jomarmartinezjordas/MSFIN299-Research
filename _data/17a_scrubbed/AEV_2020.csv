AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Current Ratio increased to 1.6x as of 31 December 2020 (compared to end-2019’s 1.3x), mainly due to higher cash balance."

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,The decrease in revenues from AboitizLand’s residential business was due to restrictions in operations caused by the government-imposed community quarantines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,The following discussion describes the performance of the Group’s SBUs for 2020 compared to 2019.

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"The variance was primarily due to (i) additional tax expenses following the ITH expirations for TSI and GMEC, (ii) the derecognition of deferred tax assets on Net operating loss carry- over (“NOLCO”) from 2018 and 2019, and (iii) additional interest expenses from AboitizPower’s bonds and loans availed of in 2019 and during the second half of 2020."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,All these offset the increase in EBITDA brought about by better coal plant availability and recognition of business interruption insurance claims.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Capacity sold increased from 3,184 megawatts (“MW”) for 2019 to 3,417 MW for 2020 due to increased contracting levels driven by the new capacity of TVI and additional portfolio contracts."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"However, due to lower demand caused by government-imposed community quarantines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower water inflow to hydro facilities, energy sold in 2020 declined by 1% to 22,754 gigawatt- hours (“GWh”) from 22,942 GWh in 2019."

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,The decrease was primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses in 2020.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"This was partly offset by revenue growth from the increase in net interest income, which grew to ₱28.7 bn, 29% higher YoY, while non-interest income was ₱13.4 bn, down 6% YoY, mainly due to lower trading gains."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Before elimination of transactions within the Group, the contribution to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV from the Food Group increased by 38% to ₱2.2 bn in 2020, compared to ₱1.6 bn in 2019."

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"However, the increase was partly offset by reduced margins of the Farms business caused by higher production costs and lower selling prices as a result of the industry-wide effect of the ASF, and lower sales volume due to transport restrictions on pork and pigs imposed in several provinces in Luzon."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Before elimination of transactions within the Group, Pilmico International Pte. Ltd. and its Subsidiaries, recorded net income of ₱1.0 bn in 2020, a 29% increase compared to 2019."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"The increase was due to (i) higher volumes, (ii) lower raw material costs, and (iii) the full year effect of the 100% ownership in Gold Coin Management Holdings Pte. Ltd.  The contribution of AboitizLand to Net Income to Equity Holders of AEV in 2020, before elimination of transactions within the Group, amounted to ₱338 mn, a 64% decrease from ₱943 mn in 2019."

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,The decrease was mainly due to the lower contribution of the Republic Cement Group from ₱612 mn in 2019 to ₱590 mn in 2020.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"This was mainly due to the contraction in the demand for cement, as construction activities declined during 2020, particularly during the enforcement of COVID-related community quarantines."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Consolidated assets (as of 31 December 2020 compared to 31 December 2019) increased by 4% to ₱609.2 bn, due to the following: Cash & Cash Equivalents increased by 42% (₱66.0 bn as of 31 December 2020 compared to ₱46.4 bn as of 31 December 2019) mainly due to the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of US dollar bonds of AEV International Pte. Ltd in January 2020."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,Trade and other receivables (current and noncurrent) increased by 5% (₱39.4 bn as of 31 December 2020 compared to ₱37.6 bn as of 31 December 2019) mainly due to increased receivables of the Real Estate Group.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,Land and improvements increased by 18% (₱3.0 bn as of 31 December 2020 compared to ₱2.6 bn as of 31 December 2019) mainly due to additional land acquisition by the Real Estate Group.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Investments in and Advances to Associates and Joint Ventures increased by ₱5.1 bn (₱145.4 bn as of 31 December 2020 compared to ₱140.4 bn as of 31 December 2019) mainly due to AboitizPower’s ₱2.3 bn additional infusion into GNPower Dinginin Ltd. Co., AboitizLand’s ₱430 mn infusion into Cebu Homegrown Developers, Inc., and the recording of ₱9.0 bn share in net earnings of Associates and Joint Ventures."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,This increase was partially reduced by the ₱5.7 bn dividends from Associates and Joint Ventures and ₱1.0 bn other comprehensive losses during the period.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"The above increases were tempered by the following decreases: Property Plant and Equipment and Investment Properties decreased by ₱6.4 bn mainly due to ₱12.7 bn attributed to depreciation & amortization, which was also offset by additions to the Food Group’s and AboitizPower’s generation and distribution assets."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Deferred Income Tax Assets decreased by 35% (₱2.0 bn as of 31 December 2020 compared to ₱3.1 bn as of 31 December 2019) mainly due to the derecognition of deferred tax assets on NOLCO of Therma Luzon, Inc. (“TLI”)."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,Total Liabilities (as of 31 December 2020 compared to 31 December 2019) increased by 4% to ₱385.6 bn due to the following: Bank loans increased by 14% (₱29.3 bn as of 31 December 2020 compared to ₱25.7 bn as of 31 December 2019) mainly due to short-term debt availments by the Power and Food Groups during 2020.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Long-term debt, which includes both current and noncurrent portions, increased by 9% (₱261.0 bn as of 31 December 2020 compared to ₱239.6 bn as of 31 December 2019) mainly due to the following: (i) issuance of US dollar bonds by AEV International Pte.

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Income tax payable increased by 30%, from ₱0.8 bn as of 31 December 2019 to ₱1.0 bn as of 31 December 2020 mainly due to the expiration of the ITH incentives of TSI and GMEC."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Derivative liabilities (net of Derivative assets, current and noncurrent) decreased from ₱2.3 bn as of 31 December 2019 to ₱2.0 bn as of 31 December 2020."
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,This was mainly due to gains in the Power Group’s cash flow hedges.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Decommissioning liability increased by 40%, from ₱3.6 bn as of 31 December 2019 to ₱5.0 bn as of 31 December 2020, mainly due to the recognition of additional decommissioning provisions on power plant assets."

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,These are partly offset by the following: ₱7.3 bn cash dividends paid during the first half of 2020.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,₱1.5 bn in cumulative translation adjustments and other comprehensive losses.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"For 2020, the Group continued to support its liquidity mainly from cash generated from operations, additional loans availed and dividends received from Associates."

AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,AEV’s Current Ratio as of 31 December 2020 increased to 1.6x compared to end-2019’s 1.3x mainly due to higher cash balance.
AEV_2020.txt,AEV,2020,"Debt-to-Equity ratio remained year-end 2019’s 1.7:1 as of 31 December 2020, as the growth in total liabilities matched the increase in equity."
