"ayala corporation’s net income in 2018 grew five percent to ₱31.8 billion from the previous year, boosted by strong earnings contribution from its real estate, telecommunications, and power businesses.

sale of goods and services expanded 13 percent to ₱274.9 billion of which 3% was a result of the adoption of pfrs 15 (new accounting standard in 2018 pertaining to revenues from contracts with customers). revenue growth was driven by ayala land which posted higher sales across all its business segments, supported by higher sales from imi’s europe, china, philippines, and mexico units as well as contribution of via optronics and manila water’s new business units.

ayala land sustained its growth momentum during the year with net income expanding 16 percent to ₱29.2 billion, primarily driven by the strong performance of its property development and commercial leasing businesses.
property development revenues jumped 18 percent to ₱120.3 billion on strong sales across its residential, office-for-sale, and commercial lot segments. residential revenues jumped 20 percent to ₱101.1 billion, while reservation sales grew 16 percent to ₱141.9 billion, bolstered by strong demand from local and overseas filipinos, which accounted for 82 percent of total sales during the year.
fresh bookings from one vertis plaza in vertis north, quezon city, the stiles east enterprise plaza in circuit makati, and completion of park triangle corporate plaza in bonifacio global city lifted the sale of office spaces, with revenues reaching ₱11.4 billion, 14% higher year-on-year. in addition, revenues from the sale of commercial and industrial lots grew 10 percent to ₱7.7 billion, lifted by sales from its estates in the visayas and mindanao region, evo city in cavite, alviera in pampanga, and cavite technopark.
meanwhile, the opening of new malls and office spaces as well as the launch of new hotel and resort rooms drove the 17 percent expansion in commercial leasing revenues to ₱34.9 billion from its year- ago level. in 2018, ayala land added 142,000 square meters of mall space with the opening of three new malls: the circuit mall in makati, the capitol central mall in bacolod, one bonifacio high street in taguig, bringing its total mall gross leasable area to 1.9 million square meters. moreover, the completion of bacolod capitol corporate center, vertis north corporate center 3, and ayala north exchange pushed up ayala land’s total office gla to 1.1 million square meters.
ayala land’s commercial leasing business was further boosted by its hotels and resorts portfolio, which continues to benefit from the growth of the country’s tourism sector. in 2018, it added 390 rooms across its portfolio of branded hotels and its own seda brand as well as bed and breakfast rooms in its lio and sicogon eco-tourism estates, bringing the total to 2,973 rooms.
the sustained strong performance of its leasing segment has supported the continued buildup of ayala land’s recurring income business, which increased at a compounded annual rate of 26 percent since 2013. meanwhile, its development income, which comprises residential, office, and lot sales, grew at a compounded annual rate of 18 percent.

manila water recorded a net income of ₱6.5 billion, 6 percent higher from the previous year, largely driven by the manila concession, boosted by the contribution of its newly acquired platforms in thailand and indonesia.
the manila concession posted steady growth, with a three percent increase in billed volume to 503 million cubic meters. this was supported by the 28 percent positive tariff adjustment granted by the metropolitan waterworks and sewerage system to be implemented on a staggered basis over a five- year period from 2018 to 2022.
outside the manila concession, revenues from manila water philippine ventures rose six percent to ₱3.3 billion. lowered billed volume across its domestic subsidiaries as well as operational and regulatory challenges, including the closure of boracay island, weighed down mwpv’s performance during the year.
manila water asia pacific’s overseas investments continues to bear fruit. it booked a 53 percent surge in equity share in net income of associates to ₱699 million. this was mainly driven by the two platforms it acquired during the year, east water in thailand, and pt sarana tirta ungaran in indonesia, which contributed ₱262.7 million and ₱1.4 million in equity earnings, respectively.
to support its diversification strategy, manila water continues to ramp up its domestic and international business development initiatives, securing 13 new businesses in 2018. these include the full concession projects in calbayog in samar, san jose in nueva ecija, and in iloilo, isabela, pangasinan, batangas, bulacan, and laguna as well as the acquisition of a 19 percent stake in east water and a 20 percent stake in pt sarana tirta ungaran.

ac energy’s net earnings expanded 16 percent to ₱4.1 billion in 2018, largely driven by its domestic thermal and renewable assets as well as higher contribution from its indonesia investments.
the strong performance and higher equity stake in gnpower mariveles, strong wind regime, and fresh contribution of its greenfield offshore project, the 75-megawatt sidrap wind farm in indonesia, as well as the full-year recognition of sd geothermal boosted ac energy’s performance during the year. equity earnings from ac energy’s investee companies reached ₱3.6 billion, 37 percent higher from the previous year. recovery of the costs incurred due to adjustments in the construction schedule of gnpower kauswagan also lifted ac energy’s net earnings during the period.
during the year, ac energy generated 2,800 gigawatt hours of attributable energy, of which 48 percent was from renewable sources. to support its strategy to scale up its renewable portfolio, ac energy raised us$410 million in green bond in january 2019, the first publicly syndicated us dollar green bond in southeast asia to be certified by the climate bonds initiative.
ac energy continued to expand its international footprint through strategic partnerships with developers and operating companies. ac energy has identified the philippines, vietnam, indonesia, and australia as key markets in its expansion strategy. the 330-mwp ninh thuan solar farm in vietnam, a joint venture between ac energy and the bim group, is expected to commence early in the second quarter of 2019. once completed, it will be one of the largest solar farms in southeast asia, benefiting ninh thuan province with income generation and job creation. ac energy also broke ground on the 80-mwp solar farms located in the provinces of khanh hoa and dak lak, in partnership with ami renewables energy. in addition, ac energy signed a memorandum of understanding with quang binh province to jointly develop a wind power project with ami renewables.

ac energy has also entered the australian renewables market through a joint venture with international
50% ownership in upc's australian business. the 1,000 mw robbins island and jims plain projects in north west tasmania and the 700 mw new england solar farm located near uralla in new south wales. it also has a further development portfolio of another 3,000 megawatts located in nsw, tasmania and victoria.

ac industrials’ net income dropped 53 percent year-on-year to ₱578 million, largely due to the weaker performance of its automotive businesses and startup losses from newly acquired businesses. this decline was partially offset by a one-time gain in its electronics manufacturing services arm.

the platform is developing
in september, ac energy announced the partial sell-down of its thermal platform to aboitiz power, which includes the gnpower mariveles and gnpower dinginin assets in bataan. the sale, valued at us$ 579.2 million, represents approximately 35% of ac energy’s attributable thermal capacity and is part of the company’s strategy to actively recycle capital and will enable the expansion of ac energy’s domestic and offshore renewable energy businesses. in late february, ac energy received approval on the transaction from the philippine competition commission.
imi’s revenues expanded 24 percent to ₱70.8 billion on the back of a 16 percent growth in revenues from traditional businesses and a 61 percent growth in recently acquired companies, via and sti. it likewise benefited from new programs in the industrial and automotive segments which grew 41 percent and 21 percent, respectively.
imi reported a net income of ₱2.4 billion, up 34 percent from a year ago, boosted by non-operating items such as net gains from the sale of a china entity and reversal of contingent consideration related to the sti acquisition, partially offset by impairment provisions on some offshore investments. the effect of the rmb and eur depreciation and higher interest rates also added downward pressure to imi’s performance during the year. excluding the impact of the one-time net gain, imi’s net income went down 49 percent year-on-year.
ac motors registered a 76 percent decline in net earnings to ₱164 million owing to significantly lower earnings of the group’s honda and isuzu dealerships, both hit by weaker sales amid an industry-wide slowdown. this was aggravated by lower contributions from ac industrials’ investments in the philippine distribution companies of isuzu and honda. meanwhile volkswagen’s sales volume was affected by the delay in delivery of its china-sourced vehicles.
ac industrials continues to ramp up its automotive retail portfolio and in 2018, it partnered with kia motors and china’s saic motor for the distribution of kia and maxus vehicles in the philippines, respectively.

share of profits of associates and joint ventures grew 11 percent to ₱20.5 billion, lifted by globe’s higher data-driven revenues plus the growth in bpi’s core businesses. the adoption of the new accounting standards pfrs 9 (financial instruments) and pfrs 15 has minimal effect in the net income of bpi and globe in 2018. higher equity in net earnings from ac energy’s investee companies, namely gn power mariveles, sd geothermal, and sidrap, as well as contribution of manila water’s new overseas investments also drove the increase. however, this was partially offset by ayala land’s consolidation of mct, previously reported as an associate, as well as ac ventures’ share in net losses of zalora and mynt.

bank of the philippine islands reported a net income of ₱23.1 billion, up 3 percent from the previous year, boosted by the robust growth of its core banking business but tempered by higher provisions and operational spending.
the bank’s total revenues grew 11 percent to ₱78.5 billion on the back of a 16 percent growth in net interest income, which reached ₱55.8 billion. the increase in net interest income was a result of a 9 percent improvement in average asset base and a 21-basis point expansion in net interest margin.
total loans stood at ₱1.35 trillion, reflecting a 13 percent growth year-on-year, boosted by strong performance of its corporate loans and credit card loans, which increased 13 percent and 24 percent, respectively. total deposits reached ₱1.59 trillion, up 1.5 percent, with current and savings accounts registering faster growth at 2.4 percent. the bank’s current account and savings account ratio stood at 71.9 percent while the loan-to-deposit ratio was at 85.4 percent.
the bank recorded higher fee income from its transaction-based service charges, credit card, and rental businesses. however, lower trust, investment management, and corporate finance fees, and securities trading income during the year, tempered bpi’s non-interest income, which slid 1 percent to ₱22.7 billion.
operating expenses totaled ₱43.6 billion for 2018, an increase of 13.2 percent year-on-year on accelerated spending to support the bank’s digitalization strategy and investments in its microfinance network. in 2018, bpi direct banko, its microfinance arm, doubled its branch network to 200. these initiatives resulted in cost-to-income ratio of 55.5 percent in 2018 from 54.3 percent a year ago.
at the end of 2018, the bank’s total assets stood at ₱2.1 trillion, up 9.5 percent from the previous year, with return on assets at 1.2 percent. with the success of its capital raising exercises - the ₱50 billion stock rights offering, the us$600 million in senior unsecured bonds, and the ₱25 billion in peso fixed rate bonds - bpi’s total capital reached ₱248.52 billion, up by 38 percent from its year-ago level. capital adequacy ratio was at 16.09 percent and common equity tier 1 ratio was at 15.19 percent.

data-driven demand across its business segments bolstered globe’s net profits, which reached ₱18.6 billion during the year.
on a post-pfrs basis, service revenues reached ₱132.9 billion. mobile revenues grew nine percent to ₱106.9 billion driven by mobile data services, which accounted for 51 percent of the segment from 44 percent a year ago. this was supported by the sustained higher prepaid top-ups, indicating greater consumer spending on mobile data. this in turn, drove the mobile data traffic growth to 956 petabytes from 600 petabytes a year ago.
globe’s home broadband business jumped 19 percent to ₱18.5 billion on continued subscriber expansion in fixed wireless solutions, specifically the home prepaid wi-fi product. similarly, its corporate data business expanded 15 percent to ₱11.8 billion amid increasing demand for fast, reliable, and secure internet connectivity and modern business solutions.
with a consistent strong revenue and well managed costs throughout the year, globe’s ebitda improved 22 percent to ₱64.9 billion, with ebitda margin at 46 percent from its year-ago level of 42 percent.
globe continues to build its network capacities to address the increasing data traffic growth and customer base as it ramped up its lte rollout. it spent ₱43.3 billion in capital expenditures in 2018, equivalent to 32 percent of its service revenues.

consolidated cost of sales and rendering services rose 12 percent to ₱196.6 billion, tracking the revenue growth.
general and administrative expenses expanded 18 percent to ₱29.8 billion, primarily driven by the combined increments in the group’s expenses, particularly ayala land’s taxes, contracted services, depreciation; manila water’s management fees, manpower-related and selling expenses, and ayala parent’s higher business development and manpower costs. moreover, the consolidation of our new subsidiaries namely mct of ayala land, mt technologies and merlin solar of ac industirals, and via optronics and sti of imi drove the higher gae during the period. this was further lifted by imi‘s restructuring costs from its employee relocation in china prior to the property sale. without the effect of these newly consolidated subsidiaries, gae grew nine percent year-on-year.

at the end of 2018, ayala’s total assets stood at ₱1.2 trillion. investments in associates and joint ventures expanded 19 percent to ₱240.1 billion owing to ayala parent’s subscription to bpi’s stock rights offering as well as new investments of manila water in east water in thailand and pt sarana in indonesia, and ac energy in renewable platforms in australia and vietnam. furthermore, the growth was lifted by additional investments of ac infrastructure in the lrt 1 project and higher share of net earnings in bpi and globe and investee companies of ayala land, manila water, and ac energy. this was partly offset by ayala land’s consolidation of mct, which was previously reported as associate as well ac ventures‘ equity losses in zalora and mynt.
investments in properties jumped 12 percent to ₱227.6 billion driven by ayala land’s expansion projects in its malls, office properties, land development initiatives, and the impact of the consolidation of mct. an adjustment in land classification required under the pfrs 15 likewise contributed to the increase.
at the end of the year, total debt at the consolidated level stood at ₱412 billion, 18 percent higher from the end-2017 level. this was driven by higher borrowings of the parent as well as higher loan balances of ayala land, manila water, and ac energy.
ayala’s balance sheet remained healthy with enough capacity to undertake investments and cover its dividend and debt obligations. as of end-2018, parent level cash stood at ₱8.5 billion, while net debt stood at ₱96 billion. loan-to-value ratio, the ratio of its parent net debt to the total value of its assets, stood at 11 percent.
the conglomerate’s peso-dollar debt split ended at 64:36 for 2018. ayala’s dollar denominated debts are fully covered by foreign currency assets.

most asean economies experienced a slowdown in 2018 as external risks weighed on local demand and exports. as the us economy showed strength, the federal reserve continued to raise policy rate that prompted asean central banks to increase interest rates to temper currency depreciation. in addition, household consumption declined as global oil prices surged, while exports struggled amid the growth slowdown in china.
moving forward, risk-aversion is expected as many awaits the development on key global geopolitical and economic issues, including the us-china trade war and the brexit.
on the domestic front, inflation challenges marked the philippine economy in 2018 as average inflation accelerated to a nine-year high, largely fueled by higher global oil prices, local food supply problems, and the weaker peso.
at the start of 2019, inflation has softened, falling to its lowest level in 10 months. many analysts believe this trend will continue over the medium term as the national government carried out efforts to ease supply of key food items to allow food prices to stabilize.
looking ahead, with inflation now in a downtrend, the philippine economy has the opportunity to return to a low-inflation and high growth environment, especially as election spending boosts overall demand. investment spending is still expected to be robust in 2019 to meet strong consumer demand.
against the backdrop of these developments, the ayala group will continue to execute on its five-year growth strategy for 2020 as it closely monitors key trends and potential risks in the global and domestic economies as well as in the industries where it operates.
ayala maintains a healthy balance sheet with access to various funding options to meet requirements. a robust risk management system allows the company to maximize opportunities for reinvention, and navigate the challenges faced by its business units.

as of end-december 2018, total cash capital expenditures stood at about p=43.3 billion (approximately us$821 million), 2% higher than last year’s level of p=42.5 billion. the increase in capex was due to globe’s continued network upgrade and expansion.
