"the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of aboitiz equity ventures, inc. (“aev or the “company” or the ""parent company"") and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidate financial statements and accompanying disclosures set forth elsewhere in this report.

management teams of the different business units continued to effectively handle their respective operations and financial requirements. as a result, profitability was sustained and the group's financial position remained strong and liquid.
associates continued to generate substantial earnings and enhance the group's consolidated bottomline despite the 6% decline in their income contribution to the group during the period in review. consolidated ebitda, which increased by 18% during 2017, translated into additional cash inflows coming from subsidiaries' operations and from dividend payments of associates. these internally-generated funds were then used to partially finance capital expenditures, settle maturing financial obligations, and pay cash dividends.
with substantial long-term debt prepayments and growth in equity during 2017, debt-to-equity ratio moved down to 1.56x (versus end-2016's 1.68x). meanwhile, the end-2017 current ratio stood at 1.56x (versus end- 2016's 2.51x) as current liabilities grew more than current assets.

for the year ended december 31, 2017, aev and its subsidiaries posted a consolidated net income of ₱21.61 billion, a 4% year-on-year (yoy) decrease. this translates to an earnings per share of ₱3.84 for the year in review. in terms of income contribution, power group still accounted for the bulk at 69%, followed by the banking and financial services, food, real estate and infrastructure groups at 18%, 7%, 3% and 3%, respectively.
the group generated a non-recurring net loss of ₱2.30 billion during 2017 (versus a ₱347 million loss in 2016) mainly from the power group's asset impairment and debt prepayment costs, which were partially reduced by a one-off recognition of lower interest expense from an acquired loan. stripping out these one-off items, the group’s core net income for the year amounted to ₱23.91 billion, 5% higher than last year. aev recorded an 18% increase during 2017 in consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (ebitda), from ₱48.13 billion to ₱56.98 billion.

aboitiz power corporation's (ap) income contribution for 2017 was ₱15.70 billion, a 2% increase from 2016's ₱15.38 billion. netting out impairment costs on its aseagas corporation (aseagas) investment, pretermination costs on the refinancing made by its subsidiary, gnpower mariveles coal plant ltd. co. (gmcp), and a one-off recognition of lower interest expense from an acquired loan, ap's contribution to core net income grew by 13% from ₱15.85 billion in 2016 to ₱17.95 billion in 2017.
power generation group's bottomline contribution to aev grew 9% during 2017 from ₱12.05 billion to ₱13.12 billion. adjusted for non-recurring items, generation group's core net income contribution increased by 19% yoy to ₱15.51 billion. this improvement was substantially attributed to the strong performance of the power generation group's hydro units and the full-period income contributed by gmcp, which was acquired in december 2016.
the power generation group's capacity sold during 2017 increased by 41% yoy, from 2,223 megawatts (mw) to 3,124 mw, mainly driven by the additional capacity of gmcp, higher generation of its hydro units, and an increase in capacities contracted.
power distribution group's earnings contribution to aev increased by 16% during 2017 from ₱2.82 billion to ₱3.29 billion. attributable electricity sales of 5,288 gwh increased by 4% during 2017. gross margin per kilowatthour (kwh) for 2017 increased to ₱1.73 from ₱1.59 in 2016. the improved margins resulted from adequate power supply, better supply mix, and recoveries on purchased power costs.

income contribution from this industry group declined by 16%, from ₱4.91 billion in 2016 to ₱4.12 billion in 2017.
on a stand-alone basis, union bank of the philippines (ubp) and its subsidiaries recorded a net income of ₱8.4 billion for 2017, 17% lower compared to the ₱10.1 billion earned in 2016. the decline was primarily due to a ₱3.8 billion one-off trading gain booked in the third quarter of 2016. ubp’s net income excluding securities trading gains, however, grew by 31% to ₱8.2 billion in 2017 from ₱6.2 billion in 2016.
petnet inc. contributed ₱20 million during 2017 from a loss of ₱2 million in 2016.

income contribution from pilmico foods corporation (pilmico) and its subsidiaries decreased by 2% during 2017 to ₱1.7 billion from ₱1.73 billion the previous year. for 2017, feeds philippines and flour both reported decreases in income contribution while farms and feeds vietnam both showed increases. the decline in net earnings of feeds philippines and flour was largely due to higher raw material and operating costs. on the other hand, feeds vietnam reported an increase in bottomline during 2017 due to growth of commercial and export product lines and some foreign exchange gains. for farms, the recovery during 2017 in live hog selling prices resulted in improved profits.

income contribution of aboitiz land, inc. (aboitizland) during 2017 amounted to ₱744 million, up 295% from ₱188 million in 2016. this growth was mainly attributed to higher industrial lot sales, improved construction progress by the residential business unit, and healthy occupancy levels from the commercial business unit. aboitizland also recognized fair valuation gains on investment properties in 2017.

republic cement and building materials, inc. (republic) posted an income contribution of ₱671 million in 2017, down 57% from 2016's ₱1.55 billion. cement demand grew modestly in 2017, offset by lower prices and increased fuel and power costs.

for the year ended december 31, 2017, aev and its subsidiaries posted a consolidated net income of ₱21.61 billion, a 4% yoy decrease.
operating profit for 2017 totalled ₱36.58 billion, a 26% increase yoy, as the ₱34.01 billion in increase in revenues surpassed the ₱26.35 billion rise in costs and expenses. the increase in revenue was mainly attributed to the performance of the power group.
power subsidiaries reported a 30% yoy increase in operating profit during 2017, from ₱26.31 billion to ₱34.17 billion, mainly due to the full-year earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) contribution from gmcp.
share in net earnings of associates for 2017 declined by 6% yoy (₱9.05 billion vs ₱9.65 billion in 2016) largely due to the decrease in ubp's income from the sale of securities and to rcbm’s income decline for 2017 resulting from lower selling prices and higher production costs. this is partly offset by growth in the net income of sn aboitizpower-magat (snap-magat) and sn aboitizpower-benguet (snap-benguet) for 2017 due to higher volume sold and ancillary revenue resulting from better hydrology.
the growth in net interest expense and other charges during 2017, coupled with the decrease in equity earnings, more than offset the increase in operating profit, and as a result, pulled down the group's overall profitability. net interest expense in 2017 increased by ₱3.61 billion yoy as debt level increased following the consolidation of gmcp debt in december 2016, and the full year impact of interest expense incurred on additional debts availed of after december 2016.
other charges of ₱26 million were incurred in 2017 versus ₱2.05 billion other income in 2016. this was mainly due to power group's impairment of its investment in aseagas and refinancing costs during 2017, versus 2016's unrealized forex gains and therma south, inc.'s (tsi) collection of settlements with suppliers.
net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased to ₱7.67 billion in 2017 from ₱6.18 billion in 2016, substantially due to the full-period recognition of the net income after tax (niat) share of gmcp's minority shareholders.
aev's consolidated comprehensive income attributable to equity holders increased by 2% from ₱22.07 billion in 2016 to ₱22.56 billion in 2017. the 4% decrease in consolidated net income was offset by the combined surge in aev's share of an associate's unrealized mark-to-market (mtm) gains on its available-for-sale (afs) investments and cumulative translation adjustments.

compared to year-end 2016 level, consolidated assets increased 6% to ₱492.24 billion as of december 31, 2017, due to the following:
a. trade and other receivables, inclusive of noncurrent portion, increased by 13% (₱24.77 billion end-2017 vs ₱22.01 billion as of december 31, 2016) mainly due to higher level of receivables of the power and food groups.
b. inventories increased by 22% (₱12.45 billion as of end-2017 vs ₱10.22 billion as of december 31, 2016) mainly due to increase in raw materials inventory of the food group and coal inventory of the power group.
c. gross of depreciation expense, the combined growth in property plant and equipment (ppe), investment properties (ip), and land and improvements (li) as of december 31, 2017 was mainly due to the following: (i) ₱12.70 billion for on-going construction of ap's power plants; (ii) ₱6.07 billion in various capital expenditures of power, food and real estate groups, (iii) ₱2.99 billion first-time consolidation of san carlos sun power, inc. (sacasun) assets; and (iv) ₱862 million gain recognized on the re-appraisal of certain investment properties. this was partly reduced by the ₱2.66 billion impairment of aseagas' biomass plant during 2017.
d. investments in and advances to associates as of december 31, 2017 increased by 6% (₱91.92 billion vs ₱86.95 billion as of december 31, 2016) mainly due to ap's ₱1.25 billion capital infusion into gn power dinginin ltd. co. (gnpd) and ₱244 million capital infusion into rp energy, the ₱275 million acquisition of balibago waterworks system, inc. (bwsi) shares by aboitiz infracapital, inc. (aic), the recording of ₱9.05 billion share in net earnings of associates, and the ₱703 million share of a banking associate's mtm gains on its afs investments during the year. this increase was partially offset by the ₱6.16 billion cash dividends received from associates during 2017.
e. other current assets increased by 30% as of december 31, 2017 (₱12.44 billion vs ₱9.58 billion as of december 31, 2016) mainly due to the rise in prepaid insurance and prepaid taxes of the power group.
f. available-for-sale (afs) investments increased by 37% (₱773 million as of december 31, 2017 vs ₱564 million as of december 31, 2016) mainly due to additional acquisitions made during the year.
g. held-to-maturity (htm) investments increased to ₱189 million as of december 31, 2017 from nil as of december 31, 2016. this was mainly due to new acquisitions made of this type of financial product during the year.
h. derivative assets (current and non-current) increased by 17% (p342 million as of december 31, 2017 vs p292 million as of december 31, 2016) mainly due to mtm gains recognized on existing forward contracts of the power group.
the above increases during 2017 were offset by the 19% decrease in deferred income tax assets (dta), (₱1.52 billion as of december 31, 2017 vs ₱1.89 billion as of december 31, 2016), mainly due to the reversal of dta set up in previous periods on the unrealized forex losses on loan restatement related to the prepayment of gmcp's loan.

consolidated short-term bank loans increased by 187% as of end-2017 (₱23.70 billion vs ₱8.26 billion as of december 31, 2016) mainly due to availments made by food group, power group, petnet, and aboitizland to fund working capital requirements. on the other hand, long-term debt decreased by 4% (₱238.84 billion as of december 31, 2017 vs ₱249.46 billion as of december 31, 2016) substantially due to the prepayment of ₱15.93 billion in therma power, inc. and ₱2.43 billion in aseagas loans, and the ₱6.72 billion settlement of maturing loans and finance lease amortization. this was partly offset by the following: (a) ap's ₱3.0 billion bond issuance; (b) gmcp's ₱3.17 billion loan; (c) the combined ₱8.29 billion additional loan availment of therma visayas, inc., hedcor bukidnon, and pagbilao electric corporation (pec) to finance on-going plant constructions; and (d) the ₱1.38 billion non-cash movement from foreign exchange differential and deferred financing costs.
trade and other payables, inclusive of noncurrent portion, increased by 12%, from ₱22.67 billion as of end-2016 to ₱25.42 billion as of end-2017, mainly due to higher level of payables to suppliers and contractors resulting from the on-going plant construction by the power group.
customers deposits decreased by 11%, from ₱7.04 billion as of end-2016 to ₱6.27 billion as of end-2017 as special deposits were refunded by distribution utilities to its customers during 2017.
asset retirement obligation (aro) increased by 62% from p1.82 billion as of end-2016 to p2.96 billion as of end- 2017 due to incremental provisions recorded during 2017.
derivative liabilities (current and non-current) decreased by 87% as of end-2017 (₱48 million vs ₱361 million as of december 31, 2016) mainly due to the derecognition of the derivative liability related to gmcp's loan, which was prepaid during 2017.

equity attributable to equity holders of the parent increased by 11% from the year-end 2016 level of ₱140.28 billion to ₱155.01 billion as of end-2017 mainly due to the ₱21.61 billion net income recorded during 2017 and aev's ₱709 million share in ubp's unrealized mtm gains recognized on its afs investments, reduced by ₱7.49 billion cash dividends paid.

for the year ended december 31, 2017, the group continued to support its liquidity mainly from cash generated from operations, additional short-term loan availments, and dividends received from associates.
compared to 2016, consolidated cash generated from operating activities in 2017 increased by ₱669 million to ₱32.68 billion, mainly due to the growth in earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization (ebida) recorded by subsidiaries during the year.
aev ended 2017 with ₱11.75 billion net cash used in investing activities versus ₱84.67 billion in 2016. this was mainly due to lower amounts spent for ongoing plant construction and investments in associates.
net cash used in financing activities in 2017 was ₱19.46 billion versus ₱52.85 billion generated in 2016. this was largely attributed to long-term loan repayments made during 2017 versus higher loan availments and the sale of treasury shares during 2016.
for 2017, net cash inflows surpassed cash outflows, resulting in a 2% increase in cash and cash equivalents from ₱63.86 billion as of year-end 2016 to ₱64.87 billion as of december 30, 2017.

backed by strong operating cash inflows, liquidity was adequately preserved. current ratio stood at 1.56x as of end-2017 from 2.51x at the start of the year, since current liabilities grew more than current assets. debt-to- equity ratio stood at 1.56:1 as of end-2017 (versus year-end 2016’s 1.68:1). this was mainly due to the growth in total equity coupled with substantial prepayment of long-term debt during 2017.

based on the information provided by unionbank’s economic research unit, aev expects the philippines to outperform its peers in 2018, with a projected 7% philippine gdp growth rate compared to 6.5% for developing asia. aev believes that it, along with its strategic business units (sbus) are in a position to take advantage of opportunities emerging from a fast-growing economy, and will continue to sustain the growth of its sbus over the long-term.

aboitizpower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. its sound financial condition will give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.

despite increased competition in the power generation market, aboitizpower believes it has built the foundation to sustain growth over the long term. in line with its growth target of reaching 4,000 mw in net attributable capacity by 2020 from its capacity of 2,999 mw as of december 31, 2017. aboitizpower expects to expand its portfolio of generation assets by implementing the projects described below:
a. greenfield and brownfield developments
aboitizpower, together with its subsidiaries and associates, is in various stages of construction or completion of the following greenfield and brownfield projects.
1. 8.5-mw maris canal hydropower plant project in ramon, isabela. this project, undertaken by sn aboitiz power-magat, was inaugurated in january 2018.
2. 420-mw pulverized coal-fired expansion unit 3 in pagbilao, quezon. this project is undertaken by pec, a partnership between tpi, a wholly-owned subsidiary of aboitizpower, and tpec holdings corporation. pec started commercial operations in march 2018.
3. 340-mw cfb coal-fired project in toledo city, cebu. this project is undertaken by tvi, a partnership between aboitizpower and the vivant group. the project involves the construction of a 2x170-mw coal-fired power plant. tvi is targeting commercial operations in may 2018 for unit 1 and in august 2018 for unit 2.
4. 68.8-mw manolo fortich hydropower plant in manolo fortich, bukidnon. the project is undertaken by hedcor bukidnon. the completion of unit 1 (43.4-mw) and unit 2 (25.4-mw) is expected in april 2018 and in july 2018, respectively.
5. 19-mw la trinidad hydropower plant in la trinidad, benguet. this project is undertaken by hedcor. it is currently under construction and targeted commercial operation date is in the second half of 2019.
6. 2x668-mw dinginin supercritical coal-fired power plant in mariveles, bataan. this project is undertaken by gnpower mariveles, a partnership composed of tpi, ac energy holdings, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ayala corporation, and power partners ltd. co. both unit 1 and unit 2, each of 668-mw, are under construction, with targeted commercial operations expected in june 2019 and july 2020, respectively.
b. alimit hydropower complex
this project, undertaken by sn aboitiz power-ifugao, involves the construction of the 120-mw alimit hydropower plant, the 250-mw alimit pumped storage facility, and the 20-mw olilicon hydropower plant in the municipalities of aguinaldo, lagawe, lamut, and mayoyao in ifugao. sn aboitizpower-ifugao is currently completing the feasibility study phase of the project. the company is also progressing in the permitting process, and is expected to continue working with the government, indigenous peoples' representatives, and industry partners. an important component of the feasibility review for this project is the free prior and informed consent from the indigenous peoples.
c. naga power plant
senator sergio r. osmeña iii filed a petition for certiorari with the supreme court to nullify the right-to-top granted by psalm to spc in relation to the 153.1 mw nppc bidding, and to enjoin the award on the ground that spc’s right-to- top is against public policy.
on february 14, 2017, tpvi, thru counsel, received a copy of the entry of judgment from the supreme court dated january 9, 2017, stating that its september 28, 2015 decision declaring the right-to-top as null and void and october 5, 2016 resolution reinstating the notice of award in favor of tpvi, have become final and executory and have been recorded in the book of entries of judgment. with regard to the motion for leave to file and admit the attached motion for reconsideration dated december 9, 2016, and the supplemental motion/petition for referral to the en banc dated january 16, 2017 filed by spc, these were denied by the supreme court in a resolution dated april 26, 2017.
d. rp energy psa
the 660-mw cfb coal-fired power plant located in redondo peninsula, subic, zambales, is a project undertaken by rp energy, a joint venture among mpgc, tpi, and tcic.
on april 20, 2016, rp energy entered into a psa with meralco for a contracted capacity of 225mw within a 20-year term. this psa was filed for approval with the erc on april 29, 2016. public hearings were subsequently held, and were concluded on january 6, 2017. to date, rpe is still awaiting the erc’s psa approval.
e. expansion of existing net attributable capacity
aboitizpower is focused on addressing the needs of its markets, including reliable supply, reasonable cost, and minimal impact on the environment and communities. aboitizpower recognizes that there is no single technology that can address the country’s energy requirements. thus, aboitizpower believes that a mix of power generation technologies is necessary to address the country’s needs. aboitizpower will continue to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies, where and when it makes sense.

aboitizpower expects that its existing distribution utilities will continue to realize modest growth. it continuously seeks efficiency and improvements in its distribution utilities’ operations in order to maintain healthy margins.
a. performance-based rate-setting
performance-based rate-setting regulation (pbr) replaced the return on rate base (rorb) mechanism, that had historically determined the distribution charges paid by customers. under pbr, distribution utilities can collect rates from customers over a four-year regulatory period.
the erc has implemented a performance incentive scheme (pis) whereby annual rate adjustments under pbr are made. the annual rate adjustments take into consideration the ability of a distribution utility to meet or exceed service performance targets set by the erc, such as: (i) the average duration of power outages; (ii) the average time of restoration to customers; and (iii) the average time to respond to customer calls. the distribution utilities are either rewarded or penalized, depending on their ability to meet these performance targets.
in april 2016, the erc posted on its website the following documents: (1) draft rules for setting distribution wheeling rates or ""rdwr"" for privately owned distribution utilities operating under performance based regulation, first entry group, fourth regulatory period; (2) draft position paper: regulatory reset for the july 1, 2015 to june 30, 2019, fourth regulatory period for the first entry group of privately-owned distribution utilities subject to performance based regulation; and (3) draft commission resolution on the issues on the implementation of pbr for privately owned dus under the rdwr. comments on the said draft documents were submitted to the erc on may 13, 2016.
through erc resolution no. 25 series of 2016 dated july 12, 2016, the erc adopted the “resolution modifying the rules for setting distribution wheeling rates (rdwr) for privately owned distribution utilities entering performance based regulation (pbr)”. based on this resolution, the fourth regulatory period shall be as follows:
(i) cotabato light: april 1, 2017 to march 31, 2021
(ii) davao light and veco: july 1, 2018 to june 30, 2022
(iii) sez and sfelapco: october 1, 2019 to september 30, 2023
on november 21, 2016, the erc posted the draft “regulatory asset base (rab) roll forward handbook for privately owned electricity distribution utilities” for comments. public consultations were conducted on january 6 and 9, 2017 in cebu city and metro manila, respectively.
in december 2015, a petition was filed by matuwid na singil sa kuryente consumer alliance, inc. (msk) with the erc wherein msk proposed a modified rorb methodology or even a modified pbr methodology, in which the distribution utilities’ capital expenditures and rate recovery thereon are approved in advance but the charges to the customers will only start after the investments have actually been made and validated by erc auditors. public consultations were set by the erc on march 17 and april 10, 2017 in its main office, and on march 22 and 24, 2017, in its field offices in cebu city and davao city, respectively.
the reset process for the fourth regulatory period has not started for all private distribution utilities as the abovementioned erc rules have not been published, which is a condition for their effectivity. due to the rules change on pbr, all distribution utilities of aboitizpower have not undergone the third regulatory period.
b. policy on competitive selection process in securing power supply agreements
in 2015, the doe issued department circular no. dc2015-06-0008, entitled “mandating all distribution utilities to undergo competitive selection process (csp) in securing power supply agreements (psa).” the doe recognizes that csp in the procurement of psas by the distribution utilities ensures long term security and certainty of electricity prices of electric power to end-users.
on november 4, 2015, the erc issued resolution no. 13, series of 2015, entitled ""a resolution directing all distribution utilities to conduct a competitive selection process in the procurement of their supply in the captive market"".
the adoption and implementation of the csp is expected to increase transparency and competition in power supply contracting. the impact of cps is prospective and, as such, its effectivity will not affect aboitizpower’s existing contracts.
on february 9, 2018, the doe issued department circular no. dc2018-02-0003, essentially modifying the existing policy on csp of power supply contracting, applicable to both electric cooperatives and private distribution utilities. distribution utilities are now mandated to create either an independent five-man third party bids and awards committee (tpbac) that will manage their csp supply procurements, or have a third party auctioneer (tpa). the tpbac and the tpa shall be accountable to its decision in the conduct of the csp.
if a tpbac is established, it shall be comprised of five (5) members, three (3) of whom shall be officers and/or employees of the distribution utility, and two (2) members shall be captive customers that are not directly or indirectly connected/ affiliated with the distribution utility.
if the relevant distribution utility opts to have a tpa to undertake csp in its procurement of power supply, the tpa shall be composed of a team of private individuals or a private corporation duly recognized in the philippines with expertise on competitive bidding and with sufficient knowledge of the electric power industry. the tpa should not be connected/ affiliated either directly or indirectly with the relevant distribution utility. the accreditation of potential tpas is handled by the erc.
c. renewable portfolio standards
on december 30, 2017, the doe issued department circular no. dc2017-12-0015, or the “renewable portfolio standards (rps) on-grid rules.” the new policy mandates distribution utilities, res, generation companies supplying directly connected customers, and other mandated energy sector participants (each, a “mandated participant”) to source or produce a certain percentage share of their energy mix from eligible renewable energy (re) facilities. under the new policy, eligible re facilities include the following technologies: biomass, waste-to-energy technology, wind, solar, hydro, ocean, geothermal, and such other re technologies that may be later identified by the doe.
the new policy mandates identified energy sector participants to comply with minimum annual rps requirement in order to meet an “aspirational target” of 35% renewable energy supply in the generation mix by the year 2030. the rps guidelines will implement a minimum annual increment re percentage to be sold to mandated participants, initially set at 1% of the net electricity sales of the mandated participant for the previous year. furthermore, this minimum annual increment re percentage will be used to determine the current year’s requirement for re certificates (recs) of the mandated participant. re sourcing shall be enforced on the third year from the issuance of the doe circular in the year 2020, with the period 2018-2019 considered as the transition phases to project developments.
the rps on-grid rules, which shall be implemented nationwide, also envisions the creation of a re market where mandated participants comply with the minimum annual rps requirement through the allocation, generation, purchase or acquisition, or generation from net-metering arrangements, of re certificates. the re certificates will represent 1 mwh of generation produced from an eligible re facility. furthermore, all mandated participants must undertake a csp in sourcing re generation supply for its customers.
d. system loss caps
in february 2018, the erc issued resolution no. 20, series of 2017 (erc resolution no. 20-2017) entitled “a resolution adopting the erc rules for setting the distribution system loss cap and establishing performance incentive scheme for distribution efficiency”. this set of rules provide for the new distribution system loss (dsl) cap that can be recovered and charged by distribution utilities to its customers, beginning in the may 2018 billing period. private distribution utilities shall charge a 6.50% dsl cap for 2018, which shall be reduced gradually on an annual basis until a dsl cap level of 5.50% is achieved by the year 2021. the aforementioned caps are exclusive of sub-transmission and substation losses.
thereafter, the private electric power operators association (pepoa) wrote a letter to the erc seeking for a one year delay of the effectivity of the recoverable rate under the new dsl cap, to the may 2019 billing period. with the additional year, the member distribution utilities could make the appropriate upgrades to their distribution systems for cost-effective system loss reduction measures, and ultimately, achieve efficient operation of their utilities. these capital expenditure projects such as upgrading transformers or primary and secondary voltage distribution lines, require careful planning, implementation, and erc approval. these material and physical changes to distribution systems cannot be achieved in two months.
aboitizpower is considering the filing of individualized system loss applications to the erc, where justifiable for a particular distribution utility. the foregoing erc resolution 20-2017 provides that a distribution utility may elect to use an alternative method in determining its applicable individualized dsl cap. aboitizpower believes that costs and benefits must be analyzed from the viewpoint of the customer determining the reasonable level of individualized dsl cap.
in february 2018, the philippine senate passed a bill setting the recoverable system loss rate for the private distribution utilities at 5%. meanwhile, the philippine house of representatives is conducting technical working group meetings to gather inputs from industry stakeholders.
iii. market and industry developments

1. it leverages on capital, which prompts unionbank to shift from trading to building recurring income to provide stable returns and predictability in the growth of shareholder value.
2. it leverages on transforming its branches and establishing competence of its sales force, rather than expanding its brick-and-mortar network, in order to cater to changing customer expectations.
3. it leverages on corporate relationships, by providing superior cash management solutions to
anchor clients and, in the process, penetrate their entire ecosystem.
4. it leverages on processes, which is about building the foundation of the bank’s automation and
digital transformation initiatives.
5. it leverages on partners, to build synergies for the expansion of products and services, as well as
customer reach.
6. it leverages on having a unique unionbank dna, focused on building the right culture and
organizational capabilities.
7. last but not the least, it leverages on its subsidiaries, such as citysavings, which is the bank’s
avenue to expand its reach towards underserved customer segments for inclusive prosperity.
on top of this, unionbank is also embarking on a digital transformation strategy which aims to enhance its competitive advantage beyond 2020. this is comprised of three major plans:
1. plan a is to digitize the bank by building the necessary infrastructure to support digital initiatives, by including having 24/7 availability, 6sigma reliability, t+0 processes, and secured banking transactions;
2. plan b is to launch a digital bank, which will deliver a fully digital customer experience through the eon brand; and
3. plan c is to engage fintechs, in order to expand unionbank’s platform partnership base and fast track customer acquisition. all these plans are deemed crucial in sustaining its level of efficiency as it scales up its business operations.
the combined financial and technological capabilities of unionbank and citysavings, driven by the purpose to deliver smart banking solutions and promote inclusive prosperity, are expected to catapult unionbank and its subsidiaries to greater heights and towards elevating the lives of its stakeholders and the communities they serve.
