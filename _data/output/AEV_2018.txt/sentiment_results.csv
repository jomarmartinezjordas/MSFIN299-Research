"the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of aboitiz equity ventures, inc. (aev or the “company” or the ""parent company"") and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures set forth elsewhere in this report.

in 2018, the company’s kpi evidenced its strong operating performance and financial stability. profitability was sustained and financial position remained strong and liquid.
with the fresh contributions during 2018 from the newly operating plants of pagbilao energy corporation (pec) an hedcor bukidnon, inc. (hedcor bukidnon), as well as from the newly acquired feeds business of gold coin managemen holdings limited (gcmh), consolidated ebitda increased by 6.5% during the year. meanwhile, associates and join ventures (jv) continued to generate substantial earnings and enhance the consolidated bottomline despite the 15% decline in their income contribution to the group.
consolidated ebitda translated into substantial cash inflows coming from subsidiaries' operations and from dividen payments of associates and jvs. internally-generated funds were then used to partially finance capital expenditures, settle maturing financial obligations, and pay cash dividends.
with equity growing more than debt during 2018, debt-to-equity ratio declined slightly to 1.55x (versus end- 2017's 1.56x). simultaneously, current ratio improved to 1.76x (versus end-2017's 1.61x) as the growth in current asset outpaced the growth of current liabilities.

for the year ended december 31, 2018, aev and its subsidiaries posted a consolidated net income of ₱22.23 bn, a 3% year-on-year (yoy) increase. this translated to earnings per share of ₱3.95 for the year in review. in terms of income contribution, the power group accounted for 73%, followed by the banking and financial services, food, real estate, and infrastructure groups at 16%, 7%, 3%, and 1%, respectively.
in 2018, the group generated non-recurring losses of ₱891 mn (versus ₱2.30 bn of non-recurring losses in 2017), consisting of net unrealized forex losses and asset impairment costs. stripping out these one-off items, the group’s core net income for the year amounted to ₱23.12 bn, 3% lower yoy. aev recorded a 6.5% increase in consolidated ebitda, from ₱56.98 bn in 2017 to ₱60.66 bn in 2018.

aboitiz power corporation (ap) ended 2018 with an income contribution of ₱16.69 bn, a 6% increase from the previous year's ₱15.70 bn. netting out unrealized forex losses and impairment costs recognized during the year, ap's contribution to the group's core net income increased by 2% yoy, from ₱17.95 bn in 2017 to ₱18.31 bn in 2018.
with the fresh income contributions during 2018 from pec and hedcor bukidnon, the power generation and retail supply groups’ bottomline contribution to aev increased by 12% from ₱13.71 bn in 2017 to ₱15.35 bn in 2018. adjusted for non-recurring items, generation and retail supply groups’ core net income contribution remained flat during 2018 at ₱16.1 bn.
capacity sold for the year was flat yoy, from 3,167 megawatts (mw) in 2017 to 3,152 mw in 2018.
power distribution group's earnings contribution to aev decreased by 5% yoy from ₱3.29 bn in 2017 to ₱3.12 bn in 2018. stripping out impairment costs, its recurring earnings contribution grew 6% yoy from ₱3.18 bn in 2017 to ₱3.36 bn in 2018. this increase was mainly attributable to electricity sales, which increased by 5% yoy to 5,540 gigawatthours (gwh). this was a result of increased consumption across all customer segments.

income contribution from this industry group decreased by 13% yoy, from ₱4.12 bn in 2017 to ₱3.58 bn in 2018.
on a stand-alone basis, union bank of the philippines (ubp) and its subsidiaries recorded a net income of ₱7.32 bn for 2018, down 13% compared to the ₱8.40 bn earned in 2017. the decrease was primarily due to lower income contribution from citysavings bank, which recorded lower loan releases to teachers.

income contribution from the food group (philippine-based pilmico foods corporation and its subsidiaries, and foreign-based pilmico international pte. ltd. and its subsidiaries which include the gold coin group) decreased by 8% to ₱1.56 bn in 2018, compared to ₱1.70 bn in 2017. on a recurring basis, during 2018 feeds philippines and farms showed a decrease in income contributions while pilmico international reported an increase. feeds philippines’ 38% yoy decline in net income was due to increased raw materials costs, which negatively affected profit margins. farms' net income decreased 15% yoy due to lower biological asset revaluation gains. these decreases were partly offset by the growth in pilmico international's net earnings, primarily due to the fresh income contribution of gcmh – an expansion in one of pilmico’s core feed milling businesses - which mitigated the effects of higher input costs to pilmico international’s animal and aqua feeds businesses.

income contribution of aboitiz land, inc. (aboitizland) for 2018 amounted to ₱645 mn, down 13% from ₱744 mn in 2017. this decrease was due to the absence during 2018 of fair valuation gains on investment properties.

republic cement and building materials, inc.'s (republic) income contribution to aev decreased by 68%, from ₱671 mn in 2017 to ₱213 mn in 2018. this was mainly due to significantly higher fuel and power costs, which offset the improvement in sales volume and prices attributable to government infrastructure spending and stable private sector demand.

for the year ended december 31, 2018, consolidated net income allocable to the equity holders of aev registered a 3% yoy increase to ₱22.23 bn, compared to ₱21.61 bn in 2017.
operating profit for 2018 amounted to ₱39.16 bn, a 7% increase yoy, as the ₱36.52 bn increase in revenues during the period surpassed the ₱33.94 bn rise in costs and expenses. this increase was mainly attributed to the performance of the power group.
power subsidiaries reported a 7% yoy increase in operating profit, from ₱34.17 bn to ₱36.50 bn, mainly due to the fresh earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) contribution from pec and hedcor bukidnon.
share in net earnings of associates and jvs declined by 15% yoy (₱7.73 bn in 2018 compared to ₱9.05 bn in 2017) due to the decrease in income contributions from the following: (i) sn aboitiz power-magat (snap-magat) and sn aboitiz power-benguet (snap-benguet), resulting from lower hydrology in 2018 as compared to the higher- than-usual hydrology levels in 2017; (ii) ubp, largely attributable to the lower 2018 net earnings of one of its subsidiaries, citysaving bank; and (iii) republic, owing to significantly higher fuel and power costs in 2018.
the growth in operating profit and other income offset the decrease in equity earnings and higher interest expense, and as a result, which resulted in an increase to the group's overall profitability. net interest expense increased by ₱1.42 bn, or 12% yoy, due to the higher average debt level in 2018.
other income increased during 2018 to ₱1.41 bn, from ₱26 mn other expense in 2017. this improvement was mainly due to the power group's collection of settlements with suppliers in 2018 (vs nil in 2017) and higher impairment costs in 2017, which were partly offset by higher foreign exchange losses in 2018.
net income attributable to non-controlling interests (nci) increased to ₱9.01 bn in 2018 from ₱7.67 bn in 2017, substantially due to the increase in consolidated net income of ap and the recognition of the niat share of gcmh's minority shareholders.
aev's consolidated comprehensive income attributable to equity holders increased by 3% yoy, from ₱22.56 bn in 2017 to ₱23.24 bn in 2018. the 3% increase in consolidated net income accounted for majority of this increase.

a. trade and other receivables, inclusive of noncurrent portion, increased by 50% (₱37.24 bn in 2018 vs ₱24.77 bn as of december 31, 2017) mainly due to the first-time consolidation of gcmh's ₱3.93 bn accounts receivable, and the higher level of the power group's receivables resulting from the take-up of psalm deferred adjustments in the books of davao light & power co., inc. (dlp) and visayan electric co., inc.

b. inventories and land and improvements increased by 51% (₱24.44 bn in 2018 vs ₱16.14 bn as of december 31, 2017). the p9.32 bn rise in inventories was mainly due to the following: (i) first-time consolidation of gcmh's ₱5.74 bn inventory; (ii) higher raw materials and real property inventories of the food group and real estate group, respectively; and (iii) higher coal inventory of the power group. this increase was partly offset by the ₱1.35 bn decline in land and improvement resulting from the reclassification of lots to be developed from land and improvements to real estate inventory.
c. gross of depreciation expense, the ₱19.66 bn combined growth in property plant and equipment (ppe), property held for sale and investment properties (ip) in 2018 was mainly due to the following: (i) ₱4.86 bn on-going construction of ap's power plants; (ii) ₱8.94 bn various capex of power, food and real estate groups; (iii) ₱4.78 bn first-time consolidation of gcmh ppe; and (iv) ₱1.0 bn upward translation adjustment by power subsidiaries using us dollar as functional currency and fair valuation gains on investment properties. property held for sale (₱676 mn in 2018 vs nil in 2017) refers to transmission assets that will be transferred and sold to the ngcp in the next 12 months, and have been reclassified from ppe.

g. debt investments at amortized cost, formerly classified as held-to-maturity investments, increased to ₱454 mn in 2018 from ₱189 mn as of december 31, 2017. this was mainly due to additional acquisitions made of this type of financial product during the year.
h. deferred income tax assets increased by 52% (₱2.32 bn in 2018 vs ₱1.53 bn as of december 31, 2017), mainly due to the corresponding deferred tax benefits recognized on the unrealized forex losses and asset impairment provision recorded by the power group during the year.

the above increases were tempered by the following decreases:
a. cash & cash equivalents decreased by 9% (₱59.03 bn as of end- 2018 vs ₱64.87 bn as of end-2017) as the funds used in investment acquisitions and repayment of maturing obligations exceeded the funds generated from operations and long-term loan availment.

pilmico, aev’s non-listed multinational food subsidiary, is an integrated food and agribusiness company based in the philippines. its businesses include flour milling, feed milling (with operations in the philippines and vietnam), livestock farming, and commodities trading. pilmico remains one of the philippines’ top flour, feeds, and farm players, with a strong track record and nationwide reach. pilmico is also one of the largest aqua feed millers in the mekong delta in south vietnam, and exports flour throughout the asean region.
in july 2018, pilmico international acquired a 75% equity stake in gcmh, the parent company of the gold coin group, one of asia’s largest privately-owned agribusiness corporations. the gold coin group is a major producer of animal feeds, operating 20 livestock and aqua feed mills across seven asian countries, including south china. it also enjoys lead market positions in key asian markets, and is well-recognized and respected in the regions where it operates. the gold coin group focuses on feed quality and consistency, thus enabling it to maintain long-term loyalty of its clients.
together with the gold coin group, pilmico international is set to become a comprehensive animal nutrition platform across the asean region, backed by strong competitive advantage in delivering scientifically balanced livestock, aqua feeds, and specialty animal nutrition.
the acquisition of gcmh has effectively expanded pilmico and the aboitiz group’s footprint in the asean region and across the asia-pacific market. growth in the coming years is expected to be driven by a combination of project developments (capacity expansions) and strategic acquisitions.
the flour business will employ a two-pronged market strategy of: (i) maximizing growth potential in the visayas region and mindanao island, while (ii) building and developing new channels in luzon through continuous sales efforts. the business likewise intends to moves forward in the value chain as it continues selling value-added flour products (noodles) and potentially expanding into a more diversified product portfolio.
the farms business is progressing towards a sow-level of 36,000 heads by 2025, supported by a focus on farm expansion and supplemented by contract farming. the expected increase in volume opens up opportunities for the business to increase its market share. this will entail unlocking more distribution channels and achieving forward integration in the value chain (meat fabrication and processing). meanwhile, the layers business intends to expand to eventually house 1.3 mn ready-to-lay hens. this expected surge in layers capacity (8x from 2018 levels) will result in a monthly production of 27 mn eggs by 2025.

likewise, aqua feeds vietnam is expected to gradually step forward to serve emerging opportunities for fingerling feeds in the region. this planned product diversification will be supported by an additional fingerling line in the existing facility. the aqua business proves to be a lucrative industry in vietnam. forward integration (fish processing) is likewise planned to take advantage of the increasing farm-gate prices of fish, such as pangasius, in the market.
on the other hand, the gold coin group has set forth a robust project pipeline with its growth-focus countries: china and vietnam.
for china, plans involve expansion of dongguan mills with a new fish and hog line facility. the current growth and demand in southern china has already filled up the existing dongguan capacities. the same is true with zhangzhou, the easternmost mill in china, which will require a new pelleting line to meet the strong demand. the automation of the finished goods packing lines, which is expected to break ground in the first half of 2019, is expected to improve efficiencies and lower labor costs in china operations.
for vietnam, both expansion and business integration activities are planned for 2019. the development of ha nam fish feed line in north vietnam is expected to be operational by the end of 2019. moreover, from successfully integrating pilmico’s animal feeds vietnam into goldcoin vietnam in early 2019, the integration of pilmico’s aqua feeds operation is being considered in order to fully integrate vietnam operations.
2019 will be a fresh start to a new multinational food group. together with the gold coin group, pilmico is surrounded with many opportunities to advance business and communities locally and abroad. the business will leverage on people development and digital transformation in order to achieve its goals to deliver solutions to customers and differentiate against competitors. through an agile workforce enabled by technology and operational excellence, the food group is confident that it is well-positioned to capitalize on market volatility and deliver its brand promise of being a customer’s partner for growth.
