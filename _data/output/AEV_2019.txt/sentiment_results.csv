"the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of aboitiz equity ventures inc. and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures set forth elsewhere in this report. the critical accounting policies section discloses certain accounting policies and management judgments that are material to the company’s results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented in this report. 

as can be gleaned from the resulting kpi values, profitability had been sustained and financial position remained liquid.
consolidated ebitda translated into substantial cash inflows coming from subsidiaries' operations and from dividend payments of associates and jvs. the internally-generated funds were then used to partially finance capital expenditures, settle maturing financial obligations and pay cash dividends.
with the debt growing while equity slightly decreased during the year, debt-to-equity ratio moved up to 1.71x (compared to end-2018's 1.54x). current ratio declined to 1.27x (compared to end-2018's 1.80x) as current liabilities grew while current assets decreased.

for the year ended december 31, 2019, aev and its subsidiaries posted a net income attributable to the equity holders of parent (“net income to equity holders of aev”) ₱22.04 bn, a 1% year-on-year (yoy) decrease. this translated to earnings per share of ₱3.91 for the year in review. the power group still accounted for the bulk of income contribution at 57%, followed by the banking and financial services, food, real estate and infrastructure groups at 30%, 7%, 4%, and 2%, respectively.
in 2019, the group generated non-recurring gains of ₱515.5 mn (compared to ₱891.2 mn in non-recurring losses in 2018), representing net unrealized foreign exchange (forex) gains, and gains on reversal of impairment provisions. without these one-off items, the group’s core net income for 2019 ₱21.52 bn, 7% lower than 2018. aev recorded a 1% decrease in consolidated ebitda for 2019 compared to 2018, declining from ₱60.65 bn to ₱60.16 bn.

the group’s revenue from sale of power decreased by 5% or ₱6.13 bn, from ₱130.73 bn in 2018 to ₱124.61 bn in 2019. the decrease was primarily attributable to therma marine, inc.’s (therma marine) and therma mobile, inc.’s (therma mobile) expiration of contracts with customers, and gnpower mariveles coal plant ltd. co.’s (gmcp) and therma south, inc.’s (tsi) lower plant availability owing to unplanned outages during the year. these decreases were partly offset by higher electricity sales of the distribution utilities and fresh revenue contributions from tvi and hedcor bukidnon. the group’s sale of power comprised 70% and 62% as a percentage of total revenues during 2018 and 2019, respectively.

the group’s revenue from sale of goods increased by 46% or ₱21.87 bn, from ₱47.75 bn in 2018 to ₱69.63 bn in 2019. the increase was primarily attributable to the full year-to-date revenue contribution of the gold coin group and the higher sales recorded by the food group’s philippine-based subsidiaries owing to higher average selling prices and volume of the feeds and flour segments. the group’s sale of goods comprised 26% and 35% as a percentage of total revenues during 2018 and 2019, respectively.

the group’s revenue from real estate increased by 5% or ₱190.9 mn, from ₱3.93 bn in 2018 to ₱4.12 bn in 2019. the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales from the residential and commercial business segments following the ramp up in operational and business performance. as a percentage of total revenues, the group’s revenue from real estate comprised 2% during each of 2018 and 2019.

the group’s combined revenue from fair value of swine, service fees and other sources decreased by 38.0% or ₱1.72 bn, from ₱4.53 bn in 2018 to ₱2.81 bn in 2019. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower swine sales resulting from the asf spread in the northern luzon, and the deconsolidation of the revenue of petnet in 2019. petnet was sold to unionbank, an associate, towards the end of 2018, and therefore, was no longer consolidated starting december 2018. as a percentage of total revenues, the group’s other revenues comprised 2% and 1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

the group’s cost of generated and purchased power decreased by 0.4% or ₱318.4 mn, from ₱71.68 bn in 2018 to ₱71.36 bn in 2019. as a percentage of total costs and expenses, the group’s cost of generated and purchased power comprised 49% and 42% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

the group’s cost of goods sold increased by 40% or ₱17.48 bn, from ₱43.69 bn in 2018 to ₱61.18 bn in 2019. the increase was primarily attributable to the full year costs of goods sold contribution of gold coin and higher feeds cost of the farms segment. as a percentage of total costs and expenses, the group’s cost of goods sold comprised 30% and 36% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

the group’s operating expenses increased by 10% or ₱3.15 bn, from ₱30.40 bn in 2018 to ₱33.55 bn in 2019. the increase was primarily attributable to the full year-to-date operating expense contribution of gold coin and the increase in operating expenses contribution of the aboitizpower group due to the start of operations of tvi and full operations of hedcor bukidnon and pagbilao unit 3 operated by pagbilao energy corporation (pec) for 2019. as a percentage of total costs and expenses, the group’s operating expenses comprised 21% and 20% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

the group’s other costs and expenses, comprising cost of real estate sales and overhead expenses, increased by 20% or ₱408.4 mn, from ₱2.01 bn in 2018 to ₱2.42 bn in 2019. the increase was primarily attributable to higher real estate sales cost, partly offset by lower overhead costs incurred by aev aviation. as a percentage of total costs and expenses, the group’s other costs and expenses comprised 1% during both 2018 and 2019, respectively.

as a result of the foregoing, the group’s operating profit decreased by 17% or ₱6.51 bn, from ₱39.16 bn in 2018 to ₱32.65 bn in 2019.

the group’s income before income tax decreased by 3% or ₱937.3 mn, from ₱35.14 bn in 2018 to ₱34.20 bn in 2019. the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating profit coupled with higher net interest expense, partly offset by higher equity earnings and other income from unrealized fair valuation gains on reappraisal of investment properties of the real estate sbu.

as a result of the foregoing, the group’s net income to equity holders of aev decreased by 1% or ₱196.8 mn, from ₱22.23 bn in 2018 to ₱22.04 bn in 2019.
net income attributable to non-controlling interests for 2019 decreased to ₱7.41 bn from ₱9.01 bn in 2018, substantially due to the decrease in consolidated net income of aboitizpower and the purchase of the remaining 25% stake of gold coin in the second quarter of 2019.

the following discussion describes the performance of the company’s sbus for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. for further discussion on the company’s operating segments, please refer to note 33 of the audited consolidated financial statements.

for 2019, aboitizpower’s contribution to net income to equity holders of aev, before elimination of transactions within the group, of ₱13.33 bn, a 20% decrease from ₱16.69 bn in 2018.
before elimination of transactions within the group, the combined contribution of the power generation segment and the res business to net income to equity holders of aev decreased by 23% from ₱15.35 bn to ₱11.76 bn in 2019. this decrease was primarily attributable to the outages experienced by the aboitizpower’s coal facilities, and exacerbated by the need to purchase replacement power at higher spot market prices. replacement power was also purchased from the spot market as the aboitizpower had contracted ahead in anticipation of therma visayas inc.’s (tvi) incoming capacity. decreased spot market sales further eroded yoy earnings. this was partly offset by the start of tvi’s commercial operations and full year operations of hedcor bukidnon, inc. (hedcor bukidnon).
capacity sold increased from 3,154 mw for 2018 to 3,184 mw for 2019.
before elimination of transactions within the group, the power distribution segment’s contribution to net income to equity holders of aev increased by 1% from ₱3.12 bn for 2018 to ₱3.16 bn for 2019. this increase was mainly attributable to the 6% increase in energy sales (5,851 gwh for 2019 compared to 5,540 gwh for 2018). this increase was partly tempered by lost margins from the decommissioning of the bajada power plant in davao.

the financial services sbu’s contribution to net income to equity holders of aev increased by 100% year- on-year, from ₱3.58 bn in 2018 to ₱7.15 bn in 2019.
on a stand-alone basis, union bank of the philippines’ (unionbank) and its subsidiaries recorded a net income of ₱14.03 bn for 2019, an increase of 100% compared to 2018. the increase was primarily due to revenue growth from the increase in earning assets and improved margins, as well as from healthy trading gains during 2019.

before elimination of transactions within the group, the contribution to net income to equity holders of aev from the food sbu increased by 2% to ₱1.58 bn for 2019, compared to ₱1.56 bn for 2018.
for 2019, the food group’s philippine subsidiaries reported a lower net income amounting to ₱821.9 mn compared to ₱1.32 bn for 2018. this was mainly due to decreased margins and volume of the farms business resulting from the african swine fever (asf) spread in northern luzon. this was partly offset by improved margins and reduced financing costs of the feeds business, and higher margins and volume of the flour business.
before elimination of transactions within the group, pilmico international pte. ltd. (pilmico international) delivered a net income of ₱1.23 bn in 2019, recording an 88.1% increase compared to 2018. this was due to the full year income contribution of gold coin management holdings (gold coin) and pilmico vietnam feeds’ improved margins due to lower raw material cost and the increased contribution of higher margin segments. during 2019, the food sbu’s international subsidiaries reported a consolidated net income of ₱760.1 mn from the ₱1.23 bn contribution of pilmico international, which was offset by the ₱467.0 mn in financing costs related to the acquisition of gold coin.

the contribution of aboitizland, inc. (aboitizland) to net income to equity holders of aev for 2019, before elimination of transactions within the group, amounted to ₱942.9 mn, an increase of 46% from ₱645.0 mn for 2018. this increase was due to the fair valuation gains on investment properties recognized in 2019, which were not present in 2018.

before elimination of transactions within the group, the contribution to net income to equity holders of aev from the infrastructure sbu increased by 186% to ₱483.4 mn for 2019, compared to ₱168.8 mn for 2018. this mainly came from the contribution of the republic cement group which increased by 187.2%, from ₱213.1 mn in 2018 to ₱612.1 mn in 2019. this was mainly due to a slight increase in private sector demand for cement, the completion of several debottlenecking projects, and improved controls on production costs.

compared to year-end 2018 level, consolidated assets increased by 6% to ₱588.39 bn as of december 31, 2019, due to the following:
the ₱6.94 bn combined growth in property plant and equipment (ppe) and investment properties (ip) was mainly due to the following: 1.) ₱9.68 bn additions to aboitizpower from cost of power plant construction and distribution assets 2.) ₱1.90 bn additions to food group; 3.) ₱896.5 mn additions to real estate; 4.) ₱1.92 bn recognition of right-of-use (rou) assets on the aev parent's leases resulting from the adoption of pfrs 16; 5.) ₱1.83 bn fair valuation gain on revaluation of ip of the real estate group; and 6.) first-time consolidation of ₱545.7 mn ip of newly-acquired aboitizland subsidiaries. this is decreased by ₱9.59 bn attributed to depreciation & amortization.
the decline in property held for sale (nil compared to ₱676 mn in 2018) was due to the sale of transmission assets to the ngcp in february 2019.
investments in and advances to associates and jvs increased by ₱33.39 bn (₱140.35 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱106.96 bn as of december 31, 2018) mainly due to aboitizpower’s ₱27,591.1 bn acquisition of additional stake and additional infusions into gnpd, aboitiz infracapital ₱240.2 mn additional acquisition of balibago waterworks system, inc. (bwsi) shares, aboitizland’s ₱230.0 mn infusions into cebu homegrown, and the recording of ₱11.50 bn share in net earnings of associates and jvs. this increase was partially reduced by the ₱5.47 bn dividends from associates and jvs during the year, ₱505.5 mn decrease in the share of cumulative translation adjustment and ₱395.0 mn share in net unrealized actuarial losses.
land and improvements increased by 10% (₱2.57 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱2.34 bn as of december 31, 2018) resulting from the land acquisitions of the real estate group.
intangible assets increased by 5% (₱66.80 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱63.78 bn as of december 31, 2018) mainly due to the capitalized costs incurred in the ongoing construction of the water treatment plant in davao.
deferred income tax assets increased by 35% (₱3.13 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱2.32 bn as of december 31, 2018) mainly due to deferred tax benefits recognized by subsidiaries on its net operating loss.
other noncurrent assets (onca) increased by 38% (₱14.13 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱10.21 bn as of december 31, 2018) primarily due to the recording of restricted cash by a power subsidiary upon its receipt of proceeds from a damage claim against its contractors, with such claim now under dispute. this was partly offset by the reclassification of vat inputs to other current assets and reversal of prepaid rental against rou assets upon adoption of pfrs 16.
the above increases were tempered by the following decreases:
cash & cash equivalents decreased by 21% (₱46.42 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱59.03 bn as of december 31, 2018) as the funds used for investment acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments and debt servicing exceeded the funds generated from operations and debt availments.
inventories decreased by 6% (₱20.78 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱21.98 bn as of december 31, 2018). this was mainly due to the following lower raw materials inventory of the food group.
derivative assets (current and non-current) decreased by 54% (₱133.46 mn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱292.8 mn as of december 31, 2018) mainly due to mark-to-market losses recognized on derivative instruments.

consolidated short-term bank loans decreased by 5% (₱25.72 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱26.98 bn as of december 31, 2018) mainly due to debt repayments made by power and food groups. on the other hand, long-term debt, which includes both current and non-current portions, increased by 13% (₱239.78 bn compared to ₱211.65 bn as of december 31, 2018) due to the following: a.) issuance of retail bonds by the company ₱5.00 bn, b.) additional ₱28.83 bn long- term loan availments by power group, and c.) additional ₱3.15 bn availment by apo agua. this was partly offset by the settlement of maturing loans.
trade and other payables, inclusive of noncurrent portion, increased by 16% as of end-2019 compared to ed-2018, from ₱37.57 bn to ₱43.65 bn, mainly due to power group's receipt of proceeds from a damage claim against contractors, with such claim now under dispute, partly offset by the settlement of the recorded payables related to the psalm deferred adjustment and payables to contractors and trade suppliers
income tax payable increased by 45%, from ₱535.2 mn as of december 31, 2018 to ₱776.6 mn as of december 31, 2019, mainly due to increased tax payable in the food group.
derivative liabilities (current and non-current) increased from ₱161.6 mn as of december 31, 2018 to ₱2.47 bn as of december 31, 2019. this was mainly due to the power group’s new foreign currency forward and commodity swap contracts, as well as fair value changes on these derivatives.
customers' deposits increased by 10% (₱6.72 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱6.13 bn as of december 31, 2018) mainly due to the growth in the customer base of the power group.
pension liability (₱639.2 mn), net of pension asset (₱190.2 mn), increased by 37.0%, from ₱327.7 mn as of december 31, 2018 to ₱448.9 mn as of december 31, 2019 mainly due to accrual of retirement expense during the year and actuarial losses for the year.
deferred income tax liabilities (dtl) increased by 33% (₱2.58 bn as of december 31, 2019 compared to ₱1.94 bn as of december 31, 2018) mainly due to the recognition of the corresponding dtl on the unrealized fair valuation gains on investment properties.

equity attributable to equity holders of the parent increased by 1% from year-end 2018 level of ₱174.69 bn to ₱176.48 bn, mainly due to the recognition under ""acquisition of non-controlling interest"" account of the ₱9.91 bn difference between purchase price and fair value of net assets acquired in the acquisition of additional stakes in gold coin and gmcp. the ₱7.44 bn cash dividends paid, ₱2.05 bn movement in cta, ₱570.0 mn unrealized actuarial losses and ₱278.4 mn retained earnings adjustment related to pfrs 16 adoption also accounted for the decrease in equity. these decreases were partly offset by the ₱22.04 bn net income recorded during the year.

for the year ended december 31, 2019, the group continued to support its liquidity mainly from cash generated from operations, additional loans availed and dividends received from associates.
compared to the cash inflow in 2018, consolidated cash generated from operating activities in 2019 increased by ₱4.34 bn to ₱42.76 bn mainly due to lower working capital requirements despite the decline in earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization (ebida).
as of end-2019, ₱39.88 bn net cash was used in investing activities compared to ₱30.76 bn during 2018. this was mainly due to higher cash disbursed on additional investments in associates and ongoing plant constructions.
net cash used in financing activities was ₱15.62 bn during 2019 compared to ₱13.22 bn in 2018. the increase was largely attributed to the settlement of short-term bank loans compared to availment in the previous year.
for 2019, net cash outflows surpassed cash inflows, resulting in a 21% decrease in cash and cash equivalents from ₱59.03 bn as of year-end 2018 to ₱46.42 bn as of december 31, 2019.

financial ratios remained healthy. current ratio stood at 1.27x at the end of 2019 from year-end 2018’s 1.80x as current liabilities increased while current assets declined. debt-to-equity ratio increased from year-end 2018’s 1.54:1 to 1.71:1 at the end of 2019 as the growth in total liabilities outpaced the growth in equity.

based on information provided by unionbank’s economic research unit (eru), aboitiz equity ventures inc. (the “company” or “aev '') expects 2020 gdp growth to be impacted by the covid-19 situation. considering the revised government forecast, our eru expects gdp to grow between 5.4% to 6.1% in 2020.
despite current challenges posed by covid-19, aev believes that the philippine economy will continue to be one of the faster growing economies of the world, and sustain the growth of its sbus over the long-term.

aboitizpower is focused on addressing the needs of its markets, namely: (1) reliable supply, at a (2) reasonable cost, and with (3) minimal impact on the environment and communities. the company believes that there is no single technology that completely addresses the country’s energy requirements; and that to address the deficiency, a mix of power generation technologies is necessary. thus, aboitizpower continues to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies where and when it makes sense.
despite increased competition in the power generation market, the aboitizpower is confident that it has built the foundation to sustain long term growth, as seen in its pipeline of new power generation projects (see part i item 1.(b)(i)(i) on principal products and services - generation of electricity on page 21 of this annual report), where target commercial operation dates for each project are discussed per business unit).
aboitizpower expects to exceed its target net attributable capacity of 4,000 mw by 2020 with the entry of gnpower dinginin.
aboitizpower’s goal is to grow its capacity to more than 9,000 mw by 2029, which aboitizpower expects to come from a portfolio of renewables and selective baseload builds. in terms of renewable energy, aboitizpower aims to maximize opportunities coming from the implementation of the renewable portfolio standards (rps) by doe starting this year. in line with doe’s aspirational goal of a 35% increase in renewable energy utilization by 2030, rps is a market-based policy that mandates power distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and res to source an agreed portion of their energy supply from renewable energy facilities. aboitizpower will also continue to pursue its international aspirations with focus on renewable energy projects in vietnam, indonesia, and myanmar. with all of these combined, it is expected that aboitizpower’s portfolio ratio will be close to a 50:50 cleanergy (renewable energy) and thermal energy mix at the end of this decade.
aboitizpower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry and expects its financial condition to give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.
aboitizpower also expects that its existing distribution utilities will continue to realize modest growth. it continuously seeks efficiency and improvements in its distribution utilities’ operations in order to maintain healthy margins.
aboitizpower, together with its partners, has alloted p41 bn for capital expenditures in 2020, almost 80% of which is for new businesses such as gnpower dinginin. the remaining balance is allocated mainly for operating and expansion initiatives.
other known trends, events, uncertainties which may have a material impact on aboitizpower have been discussed extensively in sections of the company’s 2019 sec form 20-is (e.g., for an extensive discussion on regulatory issues, see part i item 1.(b)(i)(x) on effects of existing or probable government regulations on the business on page 52 of this annual report ).

unionbank of the philippines, inc. (“unionbank” or the “bank”) believes it has progressed towards its goal of becoming one of the country’s leading retail banks, requiring the bank to increase its core earning asset base, attain a balanced source of revenue, and shift towards a recurring income business model as it fortifies its balance sheet. the majority of the bank’s revenues are already recurring in nature as its loan portfolios continues to grow. likewise, the retail segment already accounts for a significant portion of the bank’s revenues.
unionbank intends to leverage its core strengths to drive its performance. in order to provide stable returns and predictability in the growth of shareholder value, the bank utilizes its capital as it shifts from trading to building recurring income by: (i) transforming its branches and building the competence of its sales force to cater to changing customer expectations; (ii) strengthening corporate relationships by providing innovative cash management solutions to anchor clients; (iii) improving processes specifically in building the foundation of the bank’s automation and digital transformation initiatives; (iv) building synergies with its partners in order to expand customer reach, products, and services; (v) leveraging on having a unique unionbank dna, focused on building the right culture and organizational capabilities; and (vi) capitalizing on its subsidiaries, such as city savings bank (citysavings), as avenues to further capture the underserved segment for inclusive prosperity.
unionbank is also embarking on its dual transformation strategy in order to improve its current and future competitive advantages. through the use of the latest and emerging technology and platforms, the bank intends to: (i) reposition itself as a digital bank - widening its scope into adjacent markets and acquire new skills in key segments; and (ii) search for new business models of the future where banking may become embedded in people’s day-to-day lives - to integrate its financial services into ecosystems as part of the customer’s digital experience, and not merely a transaction choice.
for 2020, the bank seeks to sustain the continued growth of its lending business following five consecutive years of loan growth.
moreover, due to the bank’s repricing efforts and supported by the more benign inflation environment which led to a series of policy rate and reserve requirement ratio (rrr) cuts, the bank’s margins have recovered. as of end-december 2019, margins are up by more than 110bps compared to the levels at the start of 2019. the same is true for csb’s margins which increased by 276bps from january to december 2019. further margin improvements are expected, especially with the rate cut in february 2020 along with the expected gradual reduction of rrr to single digits in the future.
2020 continues the third phase of the bank’s digital transformation journey, which involves scaling up its digital customer touchpoints. this involved the launch of enhanced features in the unionbank online mobile app for retail customers and the portal for corporate clients, the roll out of more arks and self-service branches, and the launch of the bank’s sme business banking app for sme customers.
ubx, the bank’s innovation company and venture capital firm which focuses on fintech investments, providing tech services to our clients and building ecosystems and platforms, is also ramping up operations with its flagship platforms, namely: project i2i (financial platform for rural banks), sentro (an online business- to-business marketplace for the sme ecosystem with business solutions such as bux, a payment and logistics fulfillment platform for online merchants); and seekcap (developed in partnership with oneconnect – ping an’s fintech arm – which is an sme lending marketplace that offers affordable financing options and faster approvals).
with the key channels and platforms in place, key focus of the bank is to accelerate customer acquisition efforts, as well as deepen engagement across all digital channels, in order to realize the benefits of digital transformation for the bank and its customers alike.
unionbank has allotted ₱2 bn for capital expenditures in 2020.

food group, aev’s non-listed multinational food subsidiary, is an integrated regional agribusiness and food company based in the philippines and singapore. its businesses in the philippines include flour milling, feed milling, livestock farming and commodity trading. it also has a presence in the asean and across the asia- pacific regions through pilmico international and its subsidiaries. food group remains one of the philippines’ top flour, feeds and farm market participants with a strong track record and nationwide reach.
the food group is strategically positioned in asia pacific as a manufacturer and producer. given the trend of rising protein consumption globally, it intends to build a comprehensive animal nutrition platform in asia. this requires having a good base of products and services that facilitates creation of a portfolio of offerings that will serve both existing and future customers and markets. similar to the company’s other business segments, the food group utilizes a strategy of sustaining and strengthening the profitability of existing businesses as it looks to build new businesses.
as part of the food group’s overseas strategy, the acquisition of the gold coin group has allowed the food group to expand its customer base and geographic reach. the food group is now the fourth largest animal feed manufacturer in southeast asia, and is present in 11 countries across the asia-pacific. the gold coin group’s position provides the food group a foothold in these regional markets to explore opportunities down the value chain. geographic expansion also provides the food group and the rest of aev’s businesses access to local or regional information for potential expansion opportunities. the food group looks forward to harnessing synergies in distribution, localized operations, cross-selling, research and development, and raw materials and logistics costs.
2020 marks a new era for the food group under a new leadership. hubert de roquefeuil, the current president & ceo of gold coin management holdings, has taken the lead as the new president & ceo of the entire food group. he will be supported by the new president & ceo of pilmico foods corporation, tristan roberto aboitiz.

starting 2020, food group will pursue a strategy of balance, optimize, and develop or bod. establishing a balanced portfolio will maximize opportunities and minimize associated risks. this will be optimized through execution excellence founded on harmonized processes and systems of the entire food group. furthermore, the food group will continue to build and develop capabilities to innovate and expand the business. overall, this approach will serve as the compass in steering the food group to achieve its growth targets in the next ten years.
