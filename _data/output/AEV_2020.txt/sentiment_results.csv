the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of aboitiz equity ventures inc. and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures set forth elsewhere in this report.

consolidated ebitda translated into substantial cash inflows coming from subsidiaries’ operations. these inflows, coupled with dividends received from associates and joint ventures are the main source of internally- generated funds, which are then used to finance capital expenditures, additional investments into associates, dividends and debt service payment.
with total liabilities and equity both increasing during the 12 months of 2020, debt-to-equity ratio as of 31 december 2020 remained at end-2019’s 1.7x. current ratio increased to 1.6x as of 31 december 2020 (compared to end-2019’s 1.3x), mainly due to higher cash balance.

for the 12-month period ended 31 december 2020, aev and its subsidiaries posted a net income attributable to the equity holders of parent company (“net income to equity holders of aev”) of ₱15.4 bn, a 30% decrease year-on-year (“yoy”). this translated to earnings per share of ₱2.74 for the period in review. the power group accounted for the bulk of the income contributions to aev at 52%, followed by the banking and financial services, food, infrastructure, and real estate groups at 32%, 12%, 2%, and 2%, respectively.
during 2020, the group generated non-recurring losses of ₱477 mn compared to ₱516 mn of non- recurring gains recorded in 2019. without these one-off losses, the group’s core net income for 2020 was ₱15.9 bn, 26% lower yoy. aev recorded a 4% decrease in consolidated ebitda for 2020 compared to 2019, from ₱60.2 bn to ₱57.7 bn.

the following discussion describes material changes in the line items of the company’s statement of income and of comprehensive income for 2020 compared to 2019.

the group’s revenue from sale of power by power group decreased by 12% or ₱14.7 bn, from ₱124.6 bn in 2019 to ₱109.9 bn in 2020. the decrease was primarily attributable to (i) reduced demand resulting from the enforcement of covid-related community quarantines, and (ii) lower water inflows to the power group’s hydro facilities in northern luzon. the group’s sale of power comprised 62% and 59% as a percentage of total revenues in 2019 and in 2020, respectively.

the group’s revenue from sale of goods increased by 2% or ₱1.7 bn, from ₱69.6 bn in 2019 to ₱71.3 bn in 2020. the increase was primarily due to higher volumes for the group’s feeds business. the group’s sale of goods comprised 35% and 38% as a percentage of total revenues in 2019 and in 2020, respectively.

the group’s revenue from real estate decreased by 14% or ₱0.6 bn, from ₱4.1 bn in 2019 to ₱3.5 bn in 2020. the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue of aboitizland’s residential business, which was partly offset by the increase in revenue recognized by the industrial business from industrial lots sold. the decrease in revenues from aboitizland’s residential business was due to restrictions in operations caused by the government-imposed community quarantines in response to the covid-19 pandemic. aboitizland’s project percentage of completion, driven by the construction progress, is a key factor in the recognition of revenue and aboitizland’s construction activities were brought to a standstill during the second quarter of 2020. as a percentage of total revenues, the group’s revenue from real estate comprised 2% in both 2019 and in 2020.

the group’s combined revenue from the fair value of swine, service fees and other sources decreased by 28% or ₱0.8 bn, from ₱2.8 bn in 2019 to ₱2.0 bn in 2020. the decrease was mainly due to (i) lower swine sales resulting from african swine fever (“asf”), and (ii) lower service fees. as a percentage of total revenues, the group’s other revenues comprised 1% in both 2019 and in 2020.

the group’s cost of generated and purchased power decreased by 23% or ₱16.5 bn, from ₱71.4 bn in 2019 to ₱54.9 bn in 2020. the decrease was primarily attributable to (i) lower fuel costs due to power plant outages, and (ii) lower purchased power costs due to lower wholesale electricity spot market rates. as a percentage of total costs and expenses, the group’s cost of generated and purchased power comprised 42% and 35% in 2019 and in 2020, respectively.

the group’s cost of goods sold increased by 1% or ₱0.3 bn, from ₱61.2 bn in 2019 to ₱61.5 bn in 2020. the increase was mainly attributable to higher volume of the food group. as a percentage of total costs and expenses, the group’s cost of goods sold comprised 36% and 40% in 2019 and in 2020, respectively.

the group’s operating expenses increased by 10% or ₱3.5 bn, from ₱33.5 bn in 2019 to ₱37.0 bn in 2020. the increase was primarily attributable to (i) the increase in operating expenses of the power group resulting from the full year operations of therma visayas, inc. (“tvi”), and (ii) higher estimated credit loss provision for the power distribution group. as a percentage of total costs and expenses, the group’s operating expenses comprised 20% and 24% in 2019 and in 2020, respectively.

for 2020, the group’s other costs and expenses, comprising cost of real estate sales and overhead expenses, decreased by 24% or ₱0.6 bn, from ₱2.4 bn in 2019 to ₱1.8 bn in 2020. the decrease was mainly due to lower cost attributable to the construction of residential units. as a percentage of total costs and expenses, the group’s other costs and expenses comprised 1% in both 2019 and in 2020.

as a result of the foregoing, the group’s operating profit decreased by 4% or ₱1.2 bn, from ₱32.7 bn in 2019 to ₱31.5 bn in 2020.

the group’s income before income tax decreased by 17% or ₱5.8 bn, from ₱34.2 bn in 2019 to ₱28.4 bn in 2020. the decrease was due to (i) the lower operating profit, (ii) higher net interest expense, and (iii) lower equity earnings. moreover, income before tax for 2019 also included a one-time recognition of income from the generation rate adjustment mechanism and incremental currency exchange rate adjustment.

as a result of the foregoing, coupled with the income tax holiday (“ith”) expiry of therma south, inc. (“tsi”) and gnpower mariveles energy center ltd. co. (“gmec”, formerly gnpower mariveles coal plant ltd. co.), the group’s net income to equity holders of aev decreased by 30% or ₱6.6 bn, from ₱22.0 bn 2019 to ₱15.4 bn in 2020.
net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the 12 months ended 31 december 2020 decreased to ₱5.4 bn from ₱7.4 bn in the 12 months ended 31 december 2019. the decrease was primarily due to lower consolidated net income of aboitizpower in the 12 months of 2020.

the following discussion describes the performance of the group’s sbus for 2020 compared to 2019.
for 2020, the power group’s contribution to net income to equity holders of aev, before elimination of transactions within the group, was ₱9.7 bn, a 27% decrease from ₱13.3 bn in 2019.
before elimination of transactions within the group, the combined contribution of aboitizpower’s power generation and retail electricity supply businesses to net income to equity holders of aev decreased by 22%, from ₱11.8 bn in 2019 to ₱9.2 bn in 2020. the variance was primarily due to (i) additional tax expenses following the ith expirations for tsi and gmec, (ii) the derecognition of deferred tax assets on net operating loss carry- over (“nolco”) from 2018 and 2019, and (iii) additional interest expenses from aboitizpower’s bonds and loans availed of in 2019 and during the second half of 2020. all these offset the increase in ebitda brought about by better coal plant availability and recognition of business interruption insurance claims.
capacity sold increased from 3,184 megawatts (“mw”) for 2019 to 3,417 mw for 2020 due to increased contracting levels driven by the new capacity of tvi and additional portfolio contracts. however, due to lower demand caused by government-imposed community quarantines in response to the covid-19 pandemic and lower water inflow to hydro facilities, energy sold in 2020 declined by 1% to 22,754 gigawatt- hours (“gwh”) from 22,942 gwh in 2019.
before elimination of transactions within the group, the contribution to net income to equity holders of aev of aboitizpower’s power distribution group decreased by 14%, from ₱3.2 bn in 2019 to ₱2.7 bn in 2020. the decrease was mainly driven by lower energy consumption resulting from the enforcement of covid- related community quarantines. energy sales decreased by 8% to 5,368 gwh during 2020 from 5,854 gwh in 2019.

unionbank’s contribution to net income to equity holders of aev decreased by 18% yoy, from ₱7.2 bn in 2019 to ₱5.9 bn in 2020. the decrease was primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses in 2020. this was partly offset by revenue growth from the increase in net interest income, which grew to ₱28.7 bn, 29% higher yoy, while non-interest income was ₱13.4 bn, down 6% yoy, mainly due to lower trading gains.

before elimination of transactions within the group, the contribution to net income to equity holders of aev from the food group increased by 38% to ₱2.2 bn in 2020, compared to ₱1.6 bn in 2019.
during 2020, the food group’s philippine subsidiaries reported a net income of ₱1.2 bn, a 46% increase compared to ₱0.8 bn in 2019. the increase was mainly due to (i) higher volume and lower raw material costs for the feeds business, and (ii) improved per unit gross profit and volume of the flour business. however, the increase was partly offset by reduced margins of the farms business caused by higher production costs and lower selling prices as a result of the industry-wide effect of the asf, and lower sales volume due to transport restrictions on pork and pigs imposed in several provinces in luzon.
before elimination of transactions within the group, pilmico international pte. ltd. and its subsidiaries, recorded net income of ₱1.0 bn in 2020, a 29% increase compared to 2019. the increase was due to (i) higher volumes, (ii) lower raw material costs, and (iii) the full year effect of the 100% ownership in gold coin management holdings pte. ltd.

the contribution of aboitizland to net income to equity holders of aev in 2020, before elimination of transactions within the group, amounted to ₱338 mn, a 64% decrease from ₱943 mn in 2019. the decrease was mainly due to the fair valuation gains on investment properties recognized 2019, which were not present in 2020.

before elimination of transactions within the group, the contribution to net income to equity holders of aev from the infrastructure group decreased by 5% to ₱457 mn in 2020, compared to ₱483 mn in 2019. the decrease was mainly due to the lower contribution of the republic cement group from ₱612 mn in 2019 to ₱590 mn in 2020. this was mainly due to the contraction in the demand for cement, as construction activities declined during 2020, particularly during the enforcement of covid-related community quarantines.

consolidated assets (as of 31 december 2020 compared to 31 december 2019) increased by 4% to ₱609.2 bn, due to the following:
cash & cash equivalents increased by 42% (₱66.0 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱46.4 bn as of 31 december 2019) mainly due to the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of us dollar bonds of aev international pte. ltd in january 2020.
trade and other receivables (current and noncurrent) increased by 5% (₱39.4 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱37.6 bn as of 31 december 2019) mainly due to increased receivables of the real estate group.
land and improvements increased by 18% (₱3.0 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱2.6 bn as of 31 december 2019) mainly due to additional land acquisition by the real estate group.
investments in and advances to associates and joint ventures increased by ₱5.1 bn (₱145.4 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱140.4 bn as of 31 december 2019) mainly due to aboitizpower’s
₱2.3 bn additional infusion into gnpower dinginin ltd. co., aboitizland’s ₱430 mn infusion into cebu homegrown developers, inc., and the recording of ₱9.0 bn share in net earnings of associates and joint ventures. this increase was partially reduced by the ₱5.7 bn dividends from associates and joint ventures and ₱1.0 bn other comprehensive losses during the period.
the above increases were tempered by the following decreases:
property plant and equipment and investment properties decreased by ₱6.4 bn mainly due to ₱12.7 bn attributed to depreciation & amortization, which was also offset by additions to the food group’s and aboitizpower’s generation and distribution assets.
deferred income tax assets decreased by 35% (₱2.0 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱3.1 bn as of 31 december 2019) mainly due to the derecognition of deferred tax assets on nolco of therma luzon, inc. (“tli”).

total liabilities (as of 31 december 2020 compared to 31 december 2019) increased by 4% to ₱385.6 bn due to the following:
bank loans increased by 14% (₱29.3 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱25.7 bn as of 31 december 2019) mainly due to short-term debt availments by the power and food groups during 2020.
long-term debt, which includes both current and noncurrent portions, increased by 9% (₱261.0 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱239.6 bn as of 31 december 2019) mainly due to the following: (i) issuance of us dollar bonds by aev international pte. ltd. equivalent to ₱20.4bn, (ii) issuance of retail bonds by aboitizpower amounting to ₱9.6 bn, (iii) availment of ₱10.0 bn long term debt and issuance of ₱7.6 bn retail bonds by aev, and (iv) additional ₱3.0 bn availment by apo agua infrastructura, inc. this was partly offset by the settlement of maturing loans during 2020.
long-term obligation on power distribution system, which includes current and noncurrent portions, decreased by 8% (₱183 mn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱199 mn as of 31 december 2019) as regular annual payments were made.
lease liabilities, which includes current and noncurrent portions, decreased by 12% (₱39.8 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱45.3 bn as of 31 december 2019) due to lease payments made by tli to psalm during 2020.
trade and other payables, inclusive of noncurrent portion, decreased by 15% (₱37.3 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱43.6 bn as of 31 december 2019) mainly due to regular payments during 2020 of the psalm deferred adjustments and the settlement of payables to contractors in the power group.
income tax payable increased by 30%, from ₱0.8 bn as of 31 december 2019 to ₱1.0 bn as of 31 december 2020 mainly due to the expiration of the ith incentives of tsi and gmec.
derivative liabilities (net of derivative assets, current and noncurrent) decreased from ₱2.3 bn as of 31 december 2019 to ₱2.0 bn as of 31 december 2020. this was mainly due to gains in the power group’s cash flow hedges.
decommissioning liability increased by 40%, from ₱3.6 bn as of 31 december 2019 to ₱5.0 bn as of 31 december 2020, mainly due to the recognition of additional decommissioning provisions on power plant assets.
deferred income tax liabilities decreased by 7% (₱2.4 bn as of 31 december 2020 compared to ₱2.6 bn as of 31 december 2019) due to deferred tax on other comprehensive losses, amortization of franchise and increase in loss provisions of the power group.

equity attributable to equity holders of the parent (as of 31 december 2020 compared to 31 december 2019) increased by ₱6.6 bn from ₱176.5 bn to ₱183.1 bn, due to ₱15.4 bn net income recorded during the year. these are partly offset by the following:
₱7.3 bn cash dividends paid during the first half of 2020.
₱1.5 bn in cumulative translation adjustments and other comprehensive losses.

for 2020, the group continued to support its liquidity mainly from cash generated from operations, additional loans availed and dividends received from associates.
compared to the cash inflow during 2019, consolidated cash generated from operating activities for 2020 decreased by ₱6.5 bn to ₱36.2 bn. the decrease was mainly due to the decline in earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization coupled with higher working capital requirements and taxes paid.
as of 31 december 2020, ₱10.5 bn net cash was used in investing activities compared to ₱39.9 bn during the 12 months ended 31 december 2019. this was mainly due to lower equity infusions to associates and joint ventures during 2020 compared to 2019.
net cash used in financing activities was ₱4.3 bn for 2020 compared to ₱15.6 bn in 2019. the decrease in net cash used was largely attributed to availment of short-term and long-term loans, and the issuance of us dollar bonds in the first quarter of 2020.
for 2020, net cash inflows surpassed cash outflows, resulting in a 44% increase in cash and cash equivalents from ₱46.4 bn as of year-end 2019 to ₱66.9 bn as of 31 december 2020.

financial ratios remained healthy. aev’s current ratio as of 31 december 2020 increased to 1.6x compared to end-2019’s 1.3x mainly due to higher cash balance. debt-to-equity ratio remained year-end 2019’s 1.7:1 as of 31 december 2020, as the growth in total liabilities matched the increase in equity.

based on information provided by union bank of the philippines, inc. economic research unit, aboitiz equity ventures inc. currently expects the philippines’ gdp to grow by 5.7% in 2021 and 6.5% in 2022 on the back of normalizing consumer sentiment and spending assuming the vaccine will be rolled out in the second half of 2021.

aboitizpower remains focused on addressing the needs of its markets, namely: (1) providing reliable supply, at a reasonable cost, and with (3) minimal impact on the environment and communities. aboitizpower believes that there is no single technology that completely addresses the country’s energy requirements; and that to address the deficiency, a mix of power generation technologies is necessary. thus, aboitizpower continues to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies where and when it makes sense.

despite increased competition in the power generation market, aboitizpower believes that it has built the foundation to sustain its long term growth, as seen in its pipeline of new power generation projects (see part i item 1.(a)(i) on principal products and services - generation of electricity on page 31 of this annual report.
as of the end of 2020, aboitizpower owns 4,429 mw of net attributable capacity, of which 3,494 mw is currently operating. the company’s plan is to double its net attributable capacity by the end of the decade, with a target of more than 9,000 mw by 2030. this is expected to come from a portfolio of renewables and selective baseload builds, with the optionality for either coal or gas facilities.
aboitizpower aims to maximize opportunities from the implementation of the renewable portfolio standards (“rps”) by the doe starting in 2021. in line with doe’s aspirational goal of a 35% share in renewable energy utilization by 2030, rps is a market-based policy that mandates power distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and retail electricity suppliers to source an agreed portion of their energy supplies from renewable energy facilities. the company will continue to pursue international opportunities, with a continued focus on renewable energy projects in wind, hydro, and solar in high-growth geographic markets with acceptable regulatory environments. with all of these combined, aboitizpower aims for its portfolio ratio to be close to a 50:50 renewable energy and thermal capacity mix by the end of the current decade.
aboitizpower fully supports the does’ coal moratorium efforts to make the philippine energy system more flexible, resilient, and sustainable. the company has been a pioneer of renewable energy in the country and currently has the highest megawatts in renewable installed capacity based on market control. its diversification into thermal technologies was primarily driven by the country’s need for a reliable, accessible, and affordable power supply.
aboitizpower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. the company expects its financial condition to give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.
aboitizpower, together with its partners, has alloted ₱23 bn for capital expenditures in 2021, about 70% of which is for expansions and upgrades. these include the remaining investment for the gnpower dinginin construction, as well as for the company’s battery energy storage system projects.
despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic and the currently challenging business situation, aboitizpower continues to operate with its business continuity plans in force, in accordance with the protocols and guidelines of the government’s community quarantine. the company will continue to provide the country with the much-needed power supply for hospitals, government institutions, and critical businesses, while ensuring the safety of its teams, partners, and communities.
other known trends, events, uncertainties which may have a material impact on aboitizpower have been discussed extensively in sections of the company’s sec form 17-a (e.g. for an extensive discussion on regulatory issues, see effects of existing or probable government regulations on page 66 of this annual report.

unionbank continues its business transformation roadmap anchored on the vision to become one of the top three universal banks in the philippines in terms of return on equity, return on assets, and cost-efficiency. rather than traditional metrics such as asset size or branch network, this transformation roadmap involves a shift in focus on providing financial value to stakeholders, operational excellence, customer franchise or share of wallet, unique customer experience, and delivering superior and innovative products and services.
to fulfill its vision, the bank aims to be considered as one of the country’s great retail banks. concretely, the bank plans to achieve this goal by increasing its core earning asset base, attaining balanced sources of revenues, and shifting towards a recurring income business model as it fortifies its balance sheet.
the bank has shown progress in achieving its primary goal. majority of the bank’s revenues are already recurring in nature as its loan portfolio continues to grow above industry. likewise, the retail segment already accounts for a significant portion of the bank’s revenues.
unionbank continues to leverage on its core strengths: (i) capital, (ii) branch transformation, (iii) corporate relationships, (iv) processes, (v) partners, and (vi) its unique unionbank dna. it leverages capital by prompting a shift from trading to building recurring income to generate stable returns and predictability in the growth of shareholder value. it leverages on branch transformation by establishing the competence of the bank’s sales force, rather than expanding the brick-and-mortar network, to cater to changing customer expectations. it leverages on corporate relationships by providing superior cash management solutions to anchor clients and in the process, penetrate their entire ecosystem. it leverages on processes by building the foundation of the bank’s automation and digital transformation initiatives. it leverages on partners by building synergies for the expansion of products and services, as well as customer reach. it leverages on having a unique unionbank dna by building the right culture and organizational capabilities. the bank also leverages its subsidiaries, such as citysavings, to serve the unbanked or underbanked segment for inclusive prosperity.
in 2015, the bank embarked on a digital transformation strategy to gain a competitive advantage and capitalize on the eventual shift of the philippine banking industry towards digitalization. the banks’ digital transformation strategy consisted of two objectives:
1) to strengthen its business model by repositioning itself into an agile and digitally-transformed universal bank. the bank intends to apply higher technologies into its core banking systems and processes to quickly respond to changing customer behavior. at the same time, the bank aims to employ its digitized processes to transform citysavings and its subsidiaries into digital mass market focused-banks. the goal was to widen scope in key underbanked and unbanked segments and employ digitized processes acquired/learned by the bank to improve operational efficiencies in order to ramp up scale and accelerate achieving inclusive prosperity.
2) to search for new business models where banking may become embedded or disintermediated in people’s day-to-day lives. the objective was to immerse the bank in emerging technologies such as blockchain and the token economy which may disrupt the business of banking. the bank sought to develop, enable, and invest in financial technologies (“fintech”) companies, as their business models may evolve into the future of the financial landscape. moreover, the bank planned to make technology its core and to deliver digital platforms and solutions to meet its clients’ banking needs. all these served to integrate the bank in any supply and demand chain, making the bank indispensable in a future where banking will no longer be a transaction choice but part of an integrated experience. these have, since 2019, been led by ubx ph, the bank’s technology and innovation subsidiary.
coming from phase 1 (i.e. building the foundational infrastructure to be “digital to the core”) and phase 2 (i.e. launch of critical customer channels), unionbank is already in phase 3 of its digital transformation – the monetization and commercialization of the bank’s digital transformation. with the key channels and platforms now in place, the bank is focused on accelerating its customer acquisition and deepening engagement across all digital channels to achieve sustained growth of its lending and deposit businesses and, at the same time, reap operational efficiencies from its digital investments.
ubx ph, is also ramping up operations with its flagship platforms, namely: (i) project i2i (a blockchain-based interbank digital payment platform for financial institutions); (ii) bux (a payment gateway and logistics fulfillment platform for online merchants); (iii) sentro (a free online shop builder embedded with a payment gateway); and seekcap (a small to medium-sized enterprise lending marketplace).
2020 was a challenging year across different industries due to the pandemic. the bank is aligned with the consensus expectation that there will be a gradual path to economic recovery. thus, while the bank sees improvements in business activity and consumer sentiment in 2021, risks remain coming from economic indicators on certain sectors that have not yet fully recovered.
consequently, the bank expects a low interest environment to persist to help stimulate recovery until certain economic growth factors such as credit demand or consumer spending normalize.
the pandemic also accelerated the shift of consumer behavior towards digital banking. the bank already experienced immense growth in electronic transactions (e.g., fund transfers, bills payment, etc.), as well as the increase in users of banking applications across the industry in 2020. the bank expects this trend to continue, especially as social distancing protocols currently stand, and with vaccines not yet fully rolled out.
with the bank’s digital thrust, the bank believes it is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends as it carries on with the commercialization program of its transformation. the bank aims to accelerate digital acquisition of customers; continue to maximize engagement via digital marketing, data science, and artificial intelligence; progress towards devsecops to ramp up product development and testing; and continue pioneering experimentations to remain ahead of developments in the industry. to support these initiatives, the bank has allotted more than ₱2 bn for capital expenditures in 2021.
the bank continues to believe that its strong capitalization and above-industry profitability and efficiency ratios will continue to provide it with a cushion against potential economic headwinds.

the food group, composed of aev’s non-listed multinational food subsidiaries, is an integrated regional agribusiness and food company based in the philippines and singapore. its businesses in the philippines include flour milling, feed milling, livestock farming, and commodity trading. it remains one of the philippines’ top flour, feeds, and farm market participants and has a nationwide presence.
given the trend of rising protein consumption globally, it intends to build a comprehensive animal nutrition platform in asia. this requires having a good base of products and services that facilitates the creation of a portfolio of offerings that will serve both existing and future customers and markets. similar to the company’s other business segments, the food group utilizes a strategy of sustaining and strengthening the profitability of existing businesses as it looks to build new businesses.
the acquisition of the gold coin group has allowed the food group to expand its customer base and geographic reach. following the gcmh acquisition, the company believes that the food group is the fourth largest animal feed producer in southeast asia based on internal market data of the capacities of major players within the market. geographic expansion also provides the food group and the rest of aev’s businesses access to local or regional information for potential expansion opportunities. the food group looks forward to harnessing synergies in distribution, localized operations, cross-selling, research and development, and raw materials and logistics costs.
the food group also experienced challenges and headwinds in 2020, having to face both the covid-19 global pandemic and the asf. but relying on the overall food group strategy of “balance, optimize, and develop”, it was able to mitigate the decline in its bottom-line. this was evidenced by the increase in the 2020 net income of the feeds and flour business segments. for 2021, the food group intends, amidst the continuing challenges posed by covid-19 and asf, to maintain a balanced portfolio that will maximize opportunities and minimize associated risks. this will be optimized through execution excellence founded on harmonized processes and systems of the entire food group. furthermore, the food group will continue to build and develop capabilities to innovate and expand the business. overall, this approach will serve as the compass in steering the food group to achieve its growth targets in the coming years.
the flour business will continue employing the improved two-pronged market strategy of: (i) maximizing growth potential in the visayas region and mindanao island, while (ii) building and developing new channels in luzon for future exploration of new geographical territory. the flour business likewise intends to move forward in the value chain as it continues selling value-added flour products and potentially expanding into a more diversified product portfolio.
meanwhile, the presence of asf in the swine farming industry brings a high amount of risk as well as an opportunity. it is believed that asf has wiped out over a third of the philippines’ pig stocks and is now threatening the country’s food security. the lingering effect of the disease has resulted in a severe shortage of pork, an important part of the filipino diet, resulting in a rise in prices of many food items. this poses an opportunity for an immediate expansion and benefit on the high prices of pig and pork products. farms’ sow level capacity is expected to reach 29,020 heads by 2029. the increase in volume comes with opportunities to unlock more distribution channels and to push forward integration in the value chain.
