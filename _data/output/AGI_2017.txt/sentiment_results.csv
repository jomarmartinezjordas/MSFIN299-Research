the following discussion and analysis must be read in conjunction with the submitted audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.

the year 2017 has been a rather challenging year for the group.
the group attained p15.2 billion core net profit attributable to owners, up 4% from p14.7 billion a year ago. non-recurring loss incurred from a casualty by travellers this year was reduced by the non- recurring gain on disposal of investment by megaworld, netting out to p317 million loss as compared to p136 million non-recurring gains last year. taking into account these items, net profit to owners hit p14.9 billion, inching 1% from a year ago, with consolidated revenues reaching p141.6 billion on a 1% growth year-on-year.
megaworld, the country’s largest developer and pioneer of integrated urban townships, grew its group net profit to owners to p12.6 billion (net of p113million non-recurring gain), a 13% jump from p11.2 billion (net of p82 million non-recurring gain) a year ago. the healthy growth was underpinned by the strong performances of its key businesses in residential and hotel developments, office as well as commercial space leasing in malls and shopping centers. consolidated revenues rose 8% to p50.4 billion, boosted by the 18% soar in rentals to p11.8 billion while residential sales expanded 5% to p28.9 billion. the megaworld-geri-empire east-suntrust brands turned over 58-16-15-11 of real estate sales. in later part of 2017, geri launched its 2nd “integrated lifestyle community” and the group’s 23rd township, the 300-hectare the hamptons caliraya in lumban-cavinti, laguna, where nature becomes the focal point of development. the group’s existing landbank offers abundant nature reserves that can be nurtured and preserved as part of its future community development. megaworld has turned over 1,000 residential units in makati central business district in 2017 which included the 30-storey paseo heights and 50-storey three central, and four more towers are under construction. the group also opened its 14th lifestyle mall in 2017, which is geri’s first full-scale mall, the southwoods mall, the first and only full-scale mall development within the biñan-carmona area. the group’s operating results brought in 35% and 67% to agi’s consolidated revenues and net profit, respectively.
emperador, the world’s largest brandy company and owner of the world’s 5th largest scotch whisky manufacturer in the world, turned over p42.6 billion this year, a modest hike of 4% year-on-year attributed to strong sales from offshore subsidiaries. the scotch whisky segment turned over revenues to external customers higher by 7% year-on-year. own scotch whisky labels the dalmore and jura remained to be the growth drivers, with strong sales in uk, asia, usa, greater europe, latin america and travel retail.
the brandy segment, on the other hand, turned over revenues to external customers higher by 3% year-on-year. spanish brandies fundador and terry centenario
and harveys bristol cream sherry enjoyed a good year, with sales growing in spain, uk and the philippines. it was a challenging year for emperador brandy, yet it keeps its lead in the domestic market. higher cost of goods sold, strategic marketing expenses and unrealized foreign currency losses dragged clipped net income to p6.3 billion from p7.7 billion a year ago. nevertheless, gross profit margins (gpm) remained healthy at 35% in 2017 and 37% in 2016. the gpms of the brandy and scotch whisky segments were respectively posted at 35% and 30% in 2017 and 40% and 28% in 2016. the group accounted for 30% and 29% of agi’s consolidated revenues and net profit, respectively.
travellers, the owner and operator of rwm, reported a 5% increase in non-gaming revenues to p4.0 billion driven by hotel and mice operations. gross gaming revenues continued to recover after the loss of the second-floor gaming area in june 2017, increasing 22% in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous quarter and ending the year at p17.1 billion as property visitation continued to improve averaging 27,000 in the fourth quarter, up from 23,000 in the third quarter. the casino was closed for 27 days in june and the second-floor gaming area has not been opened. average occupancy rate for the three hotels stayed high, hovering around the 80% mark, led by remington hotel (now holiday inn express) at almost 90%. total gross revenues amounted to p21.1 billion for the current year with ebitda of p3.5 billion. the group contributed 15% and 1% to agi’s consolidated revenues and consolidated net profit, respectively.
gadc, the master franchise holder of mcdonald’s quick-service restaurants brand in the philippines, continued to grow business in 2017 exceeding targets with margins growing at pace with topline sales. within the qsr market, mcdonald’s outpaced reported market growth at 8.9%. net profit surged 34% to p1.6 billion from p1.2 billion a year ago. sales revenues rose 13% to p25.5 billion, boosted by 52 new store openings (half are company-owned), menu innovations and local store marketing activities which allowed system wide sales to reach p42.6 billion. system wide same-store-sales grew 5.8% year-on-year. total number of restaurants totaled 566 at end-2017, reaching new territories as far as antique, sorsogon, masbate and san francisco, agusan del sur. consumer touchpoints such as drivethru and online delivery have delivered double-digit growths. a strong source of incremental business is the convenient services across the country through mcdelivery which made mcdonald’s post the fastest growth in the qsr industry. these operating results translated into 18% and 8% of the consolidated revenues and net profit of agi and subsidiaries.
revenues, as a result of the foregoing, showed 1% year-on-year growth to p141.6 billion in 2017, as the strong performances in the real estate, qsr and alcoholic beverages countered rwm’s lost gaming revenues. sale of goods (real estate, alcoholic beverages, snack products) jumped 4%. service revenues (qsr, rentals, hotels, gaming) slid 2%, with sales from company-operated qsr and rental income growing 12% and 18%, respectively, cushioning the impact of 28% drop in gaming revenues.
cost and expenses expanded 2% to p113.5 billion in 2017. cost of goods sold, as a function of sales, showed same 4% expansion pace inspite of the higher costs of wine and packaging materials for alcoholic products.
share in net profits of associates and joint ventures went down 23% or p83 million, due to decrease in net profit of megaworld’s associates.
finance and other income increased 12% or p295 million higher than last year from interest income and other miscellaneous gains, including the gain on sale of investment in an associate of megaworld.
finance costs and other charges appeared to dwindle 8% because of foreign currency losses reported last year by megaworld and travellers from the translation of their foreign-currency bonds, which mitigated the high interest expenses and loss from casualty reported this year.
tax expense rose p414.8 million or a 7% increase due to higher taxable income for megaworld and gadc, and the expiration of a previously recognized deferred tax asset of travellers from 2014.
net profit totaled p21.8 billion this year, 4% down year-on-year, with net profit attributable to owners slightly up by 1% to p14.9 billion.

the group has adopted an aggressive expansion strategy since 2013, to expand its product portfolios and geographic footprint both in the philippines and across the globe to further seal growth in business earnings.
megaworld reportedly grew its group net profit by 12% to p11.6 billion (net of p82 million non-recurring gain) in 2016 from p10.4 billion (net of p181 million non-recurring gain) a year ago. the sustained double-digit growth was attributed to stronger rental revenues that soared 15% in 2016 to an all-time high of p10.0 billion as well as the group’s efficient operating cost management. consolidated revenues, excluding non-recurring gains, which include global-estate resorts, inc. (geri), empire east land holdings, inc. (empire east) and suntrust properties, inc. (suntrust), grew 4% year-on-year to p46.7 billion. the group now has twenty-two townships nationwide. in early 2016, megaworld unveiled its 21st integrated urban township, the 140-hectare maple grove in general trias, cavite and, later in 2016, the 22nd township under a new concept of ‘integrated lifestyle community’, the 640- hectare eastland heights in antipolo, rizal. township development remains to be a key strength, with focus on strengthening the various components on top of residential business, such as offices, malls and commercial developments and hotels. about 23% of real estate sales were from fort bonifacio projects, 47% from other metro manila projects, 15% from luzon outside metro manila and 14% from visayas. the megaworld-geri-empire east-suntrust brands shared 60-16-15-9 of real estate sales. the office and mall leasing business provided the earning stability for the group. hotel revenues grew 46% from a year ago as hotel portfolio expanded with the introduction of another local hotel brand, belmont hotel, which launched its first hotel in newport city last year. the group by end of 2016 has three homegrown hotel brands – richmonde, belmont and savoy. the group’s operating results brought in 33% and 51% to agi’s consolidated revenues and net profit in 2016, respectively.
emperador realized a consolidated net profit of p7.7 billion in 2016 which is 11% higher than a year ago. the year was marked with a significant milestone as emperador takes over the largest and oldest brandy producer in spain - the 286-year old bodegas fundador - at end-february, fortifying emperador as the largest brandy company in the world. the acquisition bolstered emp’s brandy business and sherry wine business in spain and united kingdom, adding four iconic brands to the group’s portfolio – ‘fundador brandy de jerez’, the first spanish brandy to be marketed; ‘terry centenario’, the largest brandy in spain; ‘tres cepas’, a market leader in equatorial guinea; and ‘harveys’, the number 1 selling sherry wine in the world and the leader in uk where it holds the distinction of being the only sherry wine that can be served to the queen in buckingham palace. consolidated revenues were reported at p41.0 billion in 2016 as compared to p43.6 billion a year ago, a 6% slowdown attributed to the termination at end-2015 of distribution of an agency brand from the scotch whisky business. own scotch whisky labels, led by dalmore and jura, were driving offshore growth particularly in usa, europe, latin america and travel retail. the brandy business, which combined emperador and fundador brands, on the other hand, turned over revenues higher by 11% year-on-year. gross profit margins improved to 37% in 2016 from 32% in 2015. the brandy segment’s gross profit rate was up 40% in 2016 as compared to 39% a year ago due to cost efficiencies. the scotch whisky segment, which has a relatively low gross margin, improved its gp rate to 28% in 2016 from 20% a year ago. the scotch whisky business contributed about 28% and 14% of emp’s consolidated revenues and net profit in 2016, respectively. ebitda, which is computed as profit before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, amounted to p11.0 billion in 2016 and p9.6 billion in 2015 representing 27% and 22% margin in the respective years. the group accounted for 29% and 34% of agi’s consolidated revenues and net profit, respectively.
travellers ended the year 2016 with revenues of p27.6 billion, net profit of p3.4 billion, and ebitda growing 4% to p6.4 billion. gross gaming revenues amounted to p23.6 billion, supported by an improved win rate and stable growth in the non-vip segment. non-gaming revenues, which include hotel and food and beverage, expanded to p2.6 billion. total room count for the three hotels [maxims hotel, remington hotel (now holiday inn express manila newport city) and marriott hotel manila] has increased to 1,454 with the addition of 228 premier rooms and suites from marriott west wing which formally opened on november 30, 2016. the marriott grand ballroom which became fully operational in june 2015 provided added revenues during the year. increased revenues were also seen in the entertainment front, specifically with the rwm’s theatrical production of annie. direct costs, which included promotional allowance, for the year contracted with the decrease in promotional allowance as travellers preferred the traditional rolling-based commissions. other operating costs increased due to higher marketing and promotions and depreciation. the group contributed 20% and 15% to agi’s consolidated revenues and consolidated net profit in 2016, respectively.
gadc reported a 62% surge in net profit in 2016 to p1.2 billion from p760 million a year ago as revenues climbed 12% to p22.8 billion. this all-time high is achieved from the opening of 44 new restaurants (22 company-owned, 21 franchised, 1 joint venture), renovation of existing restaurants, expansion of business extensions (delivery service, drive-thru, dessert centers, midnight hours and breakfast daypart), the introduction of new products (chicken fillet ala king, cheesy eggdesal, mushroom soup) and the continuous marketing and promotions of core menu. the new and improved burger mcdo was introduced on may 27, 2016. the new restaurants contributed about 3% to total system sales while business extensions comprise 23% of the total. drive-thru is the extension which has the biggest contribution of 12% of total revenues. there were 520 restaurants operating by the end of 2016, as compared to 481 restaurants a year ago, out of which 275 were company owned and operated as compared to 254 a year ago. systemwide same-store sales grew by 7% year-on-year. price increases were also strategically implemented in order to mitigate the impact of increase in cost of raw materials and to maintain the level of product quality. cost of sales and services went up by 7%, primarily due to cost of inventory which increased by 6% brought about by increase in sales volume, higher prices of imported raw materials and the shift in product mix. these operating results translated into 16% and 5% of the consolidated revenues and net profit of agi and subsidiaries for 2016.
revenues, as a result of the foregoing, totaled p139.7 billion in 2016 as compared to p139.1 billion a year ago. service revenues grew by 6% or p3.7 billion which mitigated the 3% contraction in sale of goods. the growth in service revenues (gaming, hotel, quick-service restaurants, rentals, cinemas) was attributed to the 11% increment in quick-service restaurant sales, 14% jump in rental income and 16% boom in hotel revenues. the contraction in sale of goods (real estate, alcoholic beverages and snack products) was attributed to an agency brand which emperador’s wmg stopped distributing by the end of 2015.
costs and expenses decreased 1% year-on-year. cost of goods sold, which is a function of sales, decreased by 9%, while cost of services went up 2% due to higher restaurant sales and brisk hotel and rental operations. other operating expenses rose 6% primarily due to higher general marketing expenditures and depreciation at rwm, payroll and rentals of gadc, salaries and benefits of meg employees, and operating expenses of the new spanish business unit. there was also an increase in strategic marketing spend in the scotch core malt brands as compared to a year ago.
share in net profits of associates and joint ventures increased 32% year-on-year due to take-up of share in net profit of emp’s joint venture which was up 69% this year.
finance and other income went down 22% in 2016 because of lower cash level during the year as compared to 2015 which resulted in lower interest income earnings in 2016. finance costs and other charges went up 18% due to higher interest expense in 2016 as new loans were obtained during the year.
income tax increased by 12% in 2016 as compared to a year ago, which is attributed to higher taxable income for megaworld, emp and gadc this year.
