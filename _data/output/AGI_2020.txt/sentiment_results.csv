"the following discussion and analysis must be read in conjunction with the submitted audited
consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.

the year 2020 was an unusual year as it brings unprecedented challenges due to covid-19 pandemic. the pandemic, which put the philippines in a state of calamity from march 17, is still sweeping globally as of date of this report. to curb the spread of this novel coronavirus, the governments across the world have implemented safety protocols, stay-at-home orders and varying degrees of lockdown [called community quarantine (“cq”)3 in the philippines]. at the onset, the entire luzon, its associated islands, and practically the whole country were under ecq for two months, which paralyzed all non-essential activities and public transportation. by the end of the year, most of the country was already under the more relaxed mgcq while metro manila, batangas, and the cities of iloilo, davao and tacloban continued to be under gcq.
the group has conducted business operations in compliance with government directives and protocols amidst complex challenges brought by the localized cq measures which include non-essential business suspensions, limited public transportation and public gathering restrictions. in all allowed activities and public/work places, the minimum public health standards are followed at all times and contactless connections are promoted. prolonged physical meetings are discouraged, online interactions are encouraged, and alternative work arrangements such as shifts, rotation, skeletal force and work-from-home are implemented. transport service and health and safety guards (face masks, face shields, alcohol, vitamin c and personal protective equipment) are provided to employees and workers. by the end of the year, public transportation, dine-in services and mass gatherings are still limited at about 50% capacity; curfew is still in effect; and only hotels with accreditation from the department of tourism are allowed to accommodate guests and clients.
the group has diversified revenue streams, either by type of products or by geographic locations, that help mitigate the impact of the pandemic-related lockdown restrictions. the complex challenges of the cq measures resulted in a downturn in the group’s growth trajectory with revenues and income, net profit, and net profit to owners sliding by 28%, 62% and 50%, respectively, as compared to a year ago, to end the year with p128.8 billion revenues and income, p10.3 billion net profit and p8.8 billion net profit to owners. net losses were reported by travellers and gadc that further pulled down the consolidated bottom line. nevertheless, net profit rate was registered at 8% as compared to 15% a year ago, while net-profit-to-owners rate was at 7% versus 10% a year ago.
the group saw 22%, 77% and 48% growths quarter-on-quarter in revenues and income, net profit and net profit to owners in fourth quarter, respectively, as the covid-19 restrictions gradually eased towards the christmas season.
megaworld, one of the country’s property giants, reported year-on-year declines in its revenues and income, net profit and net profit to owners of 35%, 45% and 45%, respectively, which reportedly amounted to p43.5 billion, p10.6 billion and p9.9 billion, respectively, due to curtailment in activities brought by the pandemic restrictions. net profit rate remained healthy at 24% as compared to 29% a year ago. through continuous innovation and strengthened relationships with customers and retail partners, the group was able to preserve profitability.
real estate sales amounted to p24.9 billion, down 42% from p42.6 billion a year ago due to fewer reservations, limited selling activities and restricted construction activities. megaworld implemented more flexible payment terms during the lockdown period. sales reservations amounted to p68.1 billion during the year, with around p7.8 billion worth of new project launches particularly in the upper east bacolod, iloilo business park, capital town pampanga and hamptons caliraya laguna. the megaworld-geri-empire east-suntrust/sli brands turned over 52-15-17-16 of real estate sales. the brands sold well in quezon city, pasig city, pasay city and taguig which constitute 53% of real estate sales.
rental income slid 23% to p12.9 billion primarily due to temporary closure of malls, rent concessions and lower foot traffic on reopening. rentals from its office leasing arm, megaworld premier offices amounted to p10.4 billion, at about the same level as last year. around 135-thousand sqm of fresh office spaces were leased out in iloilo, quezon city and fort bonifacio, mainly for expansion programs of existing office partners and the rest from new clients. around 145-thousand sqm of offices spaces were also renewed by various company tenants during the year. around 87-thousand sqm of office spaces were completed during the year, bringing the total leasable office inventory to 1.4 million sqm. megaworld lifestyle malls brought in p2.5b rentals. megaworld offered deferment of monthly rent without penalty until the end of the year and waived certain rental charges of mall tenants and retail partners affected by the lockdown when non-essential shops were temporarily closed.
revenues from the hotel business shrank 42% to p1.5 billion due to temporary closure of hotels, travel bans and limited hotel operations allowed under cq guidelines for the tourism and hospitality industry. since dine-in is still restricted, megaworld hotels began offering curated gourmet meals available for pick-up, take-out and delivery.
in the last quarter of 2020, however, remarkable signs of recovery were seen as real estate grew 22%, lifestyle malls 24% and hotels 25%, quarter-on-quarter as the quarantine measures eased for the holiday season.
megaworld group’s operating results brought in 33%, 100% and 79% of agi’s consolidated revenues and income, net profit and net profit to owners, respectively.
emperador, the world’s largest brandy company and owner of the world’s 5th largest scotch whisky manufacturer in the world, exhibited strong results during the year amidst the pandemic challenges. net profit to owners soared 18% year-on-year to a record-high of p8.0 billion while revenues went up 2% year-on-year to reported p52.8 billion, attesting to the strength of the group’s diversified portfolio and global operations. while on-trade and global travel retail had been affected by the lockdowns and liquor bans, emp group took advantage of the buoyant off-trade and e-commerce channels as well as new open markets to increase sales. emperador was able to navigate through the challenges, adapting to the new consumption trends and streamlining efficiencies. gross profit margin remained healthy at 31% while net profit to owners margin was higher at15% as compared to 13% a year ago.
the brandy segment realized a 20% soar in net profit to owners to p5.7billion from p4.8 billion a year ago as it turned over p36.9 billion revenues from external customers, down 2% year-on-year. the business was affected by the two-month hard lockdown from mid-march up to mid-may, when local production and distribution were completely suspended in compliance with government directive, and the liquor bans imposed in most localities. while bodegas fundador was able to continue its regular production and distribution in jerez, on-trade sales was affected but off-trade and e-commerce were strong and international market resilient. when borders began opening up in june, sales picked up in europe, asia and americas. ‘terry centenario’ remained as the fastest growing brandy and market leader in spain cornering about one-fourth of the market. ‘emperador’ garnered a leading 37%share of the market volume of the top three local manufacturers in the philippines. the segment’s gross profit margin slightly moved to 28% due to product mix and spike of cost inputs from abroad. the segment’s net profit to owners’ rate improved to 15% as the group observed prudence in its operating expenditures.
the scotch whisky segment ended the year with p16.0 billion revenues to external customers, a 14% surge year-on-year, with net profit to owners growing at the same14%pace year-on-year to p2.3billion. business in uk accelerated during the year as consumers sought out our brands in the off-trade and e- commerce channels while on-trade was effectively shut march-july and restrictions reimposed (so that not all premises were open) from november. single malts ‘jura’ and ‘tamnavulin’ captured the first and fifth positions of fastest-growing malt brands in uk while blended ‘whyte & mackay’ captured the fastest-growing blended whisky brand, as their sales soared to double-digit growths in uk. similarly, sales of ‘harveys’ had increased in uk. as markets opened up, exports to asia picked up from second quarter continuing through the rest of the year. while markets from europe, latin america, africa and middle east had been affected by the varying stages and degrees of lockdown, good growths were seen for the single malts in north america, developing markets and europe. global travel retail was the most challenged channel as most airports have remained closed and restricted. the segment’s gross profit margin was registered at 36% primarily due to shift in product mix. tight control on strategic marketing and other operating expenses (normally associated with on-trade and travel retail) boosted net profit and net profit rates.
gross profit margins (“gpm”) on consolidated level remained healthy at 31% in 2020 and 34% in 2019. the slight swing was attributed to product mix, spike of inputs abroad and promotional bundling, especially towards the last quarter of the year in time for the christmas season. the gpms of the brandy and scotch whisky segments were respectively posted at 28% and 36% in 2020 as compared to 30% and 40% in 2019.
emp group accounted for 41% of agi’s consolidated revenues and income, 82% of consolidated net profit and 81% of consolidated net profit to owners.
travellers, the owner and operator of rwm, among all the business segments, was hit the hardest by the pandemic-related measures imposed by the government that restricted foot traffic, local and international travel and tourism and the accommodation and dining services. these disruptions resulted in 57% decline in net revenues reported for the year to p12.2 billion, not enough to support the cost and expenses that pulled the bottom line 7times down from p0.9 billion to p5.5 billion in the red.
gross gaming revenues plunged 52% to p13.3 billion. casino drops fell 49% year-on-year and blended win rate was at 5%. average daily property visitation decreased 73% in 2020. the casino layout was rearranged to maximize capacity while strictly adhering to the minimum health protocols.
non-gaming revenues from hotel accommodations downscaled 58% to p2.1 billion due to check-in decline. hotel blended occupancy rate averaged 51%. hotel rooms were converted as temporary quarantine room facilities for overseas filipino workers. new service offerings were tapped to improve occupancy rates, including wfh (work from hotel) packages, special staycation packages for frontliners and locally stranded individuals, and virtual meeting packages plus the e-concierge mobile app. other revenues shrank 60% to p0.7 billion due to restrictions affecting theater, cinemas and mall operations.
in the last quarter of the year, revenues picked up 43% quarter-on-quarter (gaming 44%, non-gaming 40%) while net profit improved 28times quarter-on-quarter.
travellers contributed 9%, -55% and -32% to agi’s consolidated revenues and income, consolidated net profit, and consolidated net profit to owners, respectively.
gadc, the master franchise holder of mcdonald’s in the philippines which is a strategic partnership with the george yang group, ended the year with core revenues reaching p19.8 billion and net profit sliding to p0.6 billion in the red, which were 38% and 131% behind last year, respectively. same-store sales contracted 41% year-on-year while system-wide sales went down 38% from a year ago. the low results were the effects of the long-standing cq restrictions (in different phases) nationwide that cut foot traffic in the stores and put constraints in operations and customer spending. being in the food service, which is an essential business, mcdonald’s restaurants operated for delivery, drive-through and take-out orders, with no or limited dine-in (depending on cq stage in the locality, up to 50% capacity allowed) at limited hours (due to curfew) and menu (due to available ingredients) from mid- march. initially, when dine-in and large gatherings were not allowed, about 38% of stores remained operational; and, as the restrictions gradually eased, more stores resumed operations that by year-end 95% have re-opened as allowed by the local governments where the restaurants are located. a total of sixteen (16) stores were opened while thirty (30) non-performing ones were closed during the year, to end the year with 655 stores as compared to 669 stores at the beginning of the year.
convenience through its delivery and drive-thru channels significantly contributed to sales recovery, accounting for 19% and 29% of system-wide sales for the year. within mcdelivery, innovation played a critical role as digital sales comprise bulk of total delivery sales - with aggressive expansion and programs with food aggregators like grab food and food panda, and continued push for the mcdelivery app. as delivery boosted growth, mcdonald’s promoted bundles or group meals for in-home consumption and free delivery for a minimum purchase amount.
business was already improving in the second half of the year with net profit of p0.4 billion realized in the fourth quarter, a 246% increase quarter-on-quarter, as core revenues increased 25% quarter-on- quarter. system-wide sales in the fourth quarter grew 31% quarter-on-quarter.
the group has maintained positive cash flows from operations during the year and secured funding from local banks, thereby sustaining strong financial position at year-end.
these operating results translated into 16%, -5% and -3% of the consolidated revenues and income, net profit and net profit to owners of agi and subsidiaries, respectively.
revenues and other income, as a result of the foregoing, reached p128.8 billion in 2020, a 28% or p51.2 billion drop from p180.0 billion in 2019. sale of goods (real estate, alcoholic beverages, snack products) went down 18% or p16.5 billion to p77.0 billion from p93.5 billion a year ago, due to the 42% decline in real estate sales. service revenues (qsr, gaming, rentals, hotels, cinemas) decelerated 41% or p33.5 billion to p47.5 billion from p81.0 billion a year ago, due to reduction in all revenues under this account. share in net profits of associates and joint ventures decreased by 36% or p65 million, mainly from losses incurred by meg’s associates this year.
