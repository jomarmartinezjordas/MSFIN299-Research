ayala land is subject to significant competition in each of its principal businesses of property development, commercial leasing and services. in property development, ayala land competes with other developers to attract condominium and house and lot buyers. in commercial leasing, it competes for shopping center and office space tenants, as well as customers of the retail outlets, restaurants, and hotels and resorts across the country.
however, ayala land believes that, at present, there is no single property company that has a significant presence in all sectors of the property market.

with respect to high-end and middle-income land and condominium sales, ayala land competes for buyers primarily on the basis of reputation, reliability, price, quality, and the location of the community in which the relevant site is located. for the affordable, economic and socialized housing markets, ayala land competes for buyers based on quality of projects, affordability of units and availability of in-house financing. ayala land is also actively tapping the overseas filipino market. in addition it has seen demand from foreign buyers both residing in the country and abroad.

for its shopping centers, ayala land competes for tenants primarily based on the ability of the shopping center to attract customers. this is typically hinged on the location and the tenant-mix of the retail center, the reputation of the retail center owner, as well as rental and other charges. the market for shopping centers has become competitive and with the growing number of pipeline and new shopping center openings across the country. some competing shopping centers are located within relatively close proximity of ayala land's commercial centers.
with respect to its office rental properties, ayala land competes for tenants primarily based on the quality and location of the relevant building, reputation of the building's owner, quality of support services provided by the property manager, and rental and other charges. the company is addressing the continuing demand from bpos and corporate by providing fully integrated and well maintained developments (high rise or campus facility) in key locations in the country.

the local hotel and resort sector is largely driven by foreign and local travel for leisure or business purposes. any slowdown in tourism and business activity due to global financial and local political turmoil and security concerns could potentially limit growth of the company's hotels and resorts.

ayala land's construction business is benefiting from the improved performance of the construction industry, particularly from an uptick in development activities mostly from the residential and retail sector. with booming construction across the country, ayala land must manage the risk of providing enough skilled workers to deploy to its various projects. any slowdown in the construction business could potentially cap growth of the company's construction arm.

ayala land directly manages its properties as well as other third-party properties through ayala property management corporation. its employees directly interface with customers and must ensure that ayala land’s brand, quality and reputation are upheld in the regular upkeep of managed properties. employees must continuously be trained to be able to provide high-quality service in order to preserve ayala land’s brand equity.
other risks that the company may be exposed to are the following:
changes in philippine and international interest rates happening at a swift pace
changes in the value of the peso
changes in construction material and labor costs, power rates and other costs
changes in laws and regulations that apply to the philippine real estate industry
changes in the country's political and economic conditions
changes in the country’s liquidity and credit exposures
to mitigate the above mentioned risks, ayala land shall continue to adopt appropriate risk management tools as well as conservative financial and operational controls and policies to manage the various business risks it faces.",0.9521065354347229,0.031089337542653084,0.016804171726107597
