aboitizpower remains focused on addressing the needs of its markets, namely: (1) providing reliable supply, at a (2) reasonable cost, and with (3) minimal impact on the environment and communities. the company believes that there is no single technology that completely addresses the country’s energy requirements and that to address the deficiency, a mix of power generation technologies is necessary. thus, aboitizpower continues to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies where and when it makes sense.
despite increased competition in the power generation market, the company believes that it has built the foundation to sustain its long-term growth, as seen in its pipeline of new power generation projects.
the company has over 1,000 mw of projects under construction which are expected to commercially operate in 2022: the gnpower dinginin project (“dinginin project”); the pv sinag power cayanga project (“cayanga solar project”); the tmi maco hybrid battery energy storage system project (“maco bess project”).
gnpd unit 1 officially went on cod last january 26, 2022. unit 2 has started commissioning. the target for unit 2's initial synchronization remains to be the second quarter of 2022, from which gnpd unit 2 may start earning revenues.
the pv sinag power cayanga project is for the construction of a 94 megawatts peak (mwp) solar power plant located in barangay cayanga, municipality of bugallon, pangasinan. the epc contract was awarded to jgc philippines last december 2021. its groundbreaking ceremony was held last february 2022. the project is expected to commercially operate by q4 2022.
the maco bess project is located in maco, compostela valley. it has a storage capacity of 49 mw and is intended to be used for ancillary services. development activities are ongoing to integrate the battery energy storage system with tmi’s maco oil barge. the project nears completion at around 90% with the bess barge moored in the tmi facility right next to the power barge. the mobilized technical team continues to work on the testing and commissioning activities to get the plant running in may 2022. it will serve as a model for future battery investments as well as hybrid renewable energy projects.
on top of the projects under construction, the company has a 160 mwp of re project expected to be issued a notice to proceed in 2022: the pv sinag power laoag project (“laoag solar project”). the laoag solar project is expected to commercially operate by q3 2023.
the company also has an additional capacity of 721 mw of re projects under priority development which are expected to commercially operate by 2024 to 2025: the 10 mw sn aboitizpower magat bess project; the 84 mwp pv sinag power san manuel solar project; the 44 mwp ap renewable energy corporation tarlac solar project; the 40 mw hedcor bukidnon kibungan hydro project; the 212 mwp pv sinag power olongapo solar project; the 56 mwp pv sinag power ramon solar project; the 50 mwp pv sinag power gamu solar project ; the 75 mwp sn aboitizpower-magat floating solar project; and the 150 mwp aboitiz solar power inc calatrava solar project.
in relation to aboitizpower’s existing capacity, the steam field operator for ap renewables inc. (apri) has commenced the drilling of 12 new wells, which are expected to result in a minimum 50 mw of aggregated individual well capacity by 2023. four wells were completed as of 2021,. four more will be added by 2022, and another four by 2023. in tiwi, the initiative to convert waste heat from the geothermal brine to power a 15 mw binary power plant is reaching the final stages of tender. the project is expected to commercially operate by the q3 of 2023.
the company targets to double its capacity to 9,200 mw by 2030. it intends to achieve a 50:50 balance between its renewable (“cleanergy”) and thermal capacities, without new coal builds. this is expected to come from a portfolio of renewables and selective baseload builds.
the company aims to maximize opportunities from the implementation of the renewable portfolio standards (“rps”) by the doe. in line with doe’s aspirational goal of a 35% share in renewable energy utilization by 2030, rps is a market- based policy that mandates power distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and retail electricity suppliers to source an agreed portion of their energy supplies from renewable energy facilities. the company will continue to pursue international opportunities, with a continued focus on renewable energy projects in wind, hydro, and solar in high growth geographic markets with acceptable regulatory environments.
the company targets to significantly grow cleanergy by 3,700 mw, both domestically and internationally, and bring its renewable portfolio to 4,600 mw by 2030.
the company is optimizing its existing baseload facilities to meet critical market needs. baseload demand will continue to increase. there is a need to address this in the absence of new coal plants. aboitizpower is currently conducting studies for viable alternatives to coal. in the event of a critical shortage, aboitizpower’s third unit options located in existing baseload facilities may respond if called upon. the company is also shifting its focus to gas for baseload growth. it has early feasibility studies, and within the next ten years, expects to construct one gas plant with a capacity of 1,000 mw, unless a cleaner technology proves to be the more economical option.
aboitizpower fully supports the doe’s coal moratorium efforts to make the philippine energy system more flexible, resilient, and sustainable. aboitizpower is also closely and proactively monitoring the risks associated with climate- related regulations and initiatives, including recent discussions on the early retirement of coal assets in the philippines and indonesia. aboitizpower, through its parent company, aev, is the first philippine company to sign up and commit to the task force on climate-related financial disclosure framework. the company has taken steps to proactively quantify the potential impacts of various climate regulations on its assets. the company is monitoring this risk as part of its risk management framework and is developing strategies to manage risks that are above certain risk thresholds.
given the current state of power needs in the philippines and the expected build progression of new plants over the next ten years, aboitizpower believes its existing coal assets will need to continue to play a significant role for at least another 15 to 20 years. aboitizpower is always looking at improvements to make sure it continues to operate its assets responsibly and in compliance with all regulations.
the company believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. it expects its financial condition to give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.

aboitizpower, together with its partners, has allotted ₱28 bn for capital expenditures in 2022, for the development and construction of various solar power, hydro power, and battery energy-storage systems, and the continuous improvement of the reliability of baseload plants.
these include remaining investment for gnpd’s construction, a general overhaul of gmec, and development and construction of solar and hydro plants, as well as bess projects. the balance is allocated for maintenance of business, primarily to ensure the availability of sufficient baseload during the
2022 election period.

last december 2021, jera completed the acquisition of a 27% ownership stake in aboitizpower, which includes two board seats. the partnership enables aboitizpower’s ten-year renewable energy expansion journey.
aboitizpower and jera have agreed to explore immediate collaboration in the following areas: 1) development of power projects, including (liquified natural gas) lng-to-power projects; 2) management and sourcing of lng fuel supply; and 3) potential participation in aspects of plant operation and maintenance (o&m).
other known trends, events, uncertainties which may have a material impact on aboitizpower have been discussed extensively in sections of the company’s annual report (e.g. for an extensive discussion on regulatory issues, see effect of existing or probable government regulations on the business on page 39 of the company’s 2021 annual report).",0.884607195854187,0.04987833648920059,0.06551451981067657
