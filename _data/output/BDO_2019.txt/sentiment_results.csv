philippine economic growth this year is expected to be driven by upbeat government spending with the early passage of the 2020 budget, firmer household consumption on favorable demographics, and supportive monetary policy, with inflation seen settling within the bsp's 2%-4% target. the country's outlook upgrade from “stable” to ""positive"" by fitch ratings, brings the philippines closer to a ratings upgrade, underscoring the country's solid macroeconomic fundamentals.
downrisks to the outlook, however, are the impact of the taal volcano eruption, the uncertainty in government contracts, and the potential economic fallout on the global economy generated by a prolonged duration of the 2019 coronavirus disease (covid-19). philippine economic pace is seen to continue in 2020, in line with modest global growth prospects. bdo will continue to have sustained, albeit tempered loan growth while asset quality is generally expected to remain benign.
