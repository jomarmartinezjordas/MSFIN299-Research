the philippine economy may expand by at least 6.5% in 2019 on the back of a sustained surge in capital goods spending. should oil prices stabilize in 2019, growth may even accelerate further as household spending is expected to recover from the 2018 slowdown and as overall spending activity picks up ahead of the may 2019 mid-term elections. on the production side, the construction industry may benefit from the government’s “build, build, build” program, especially if the groundbreaking of big ticket projects (subway, airport, etc.) finally kicks in this year.
a manageable widening of the trade deficit is expected to translate to a modest depreciation of the philippine peso with additional pressure from global trade disputes and financial market volatility among major markets.
inflation is expected to return to the 2.0% to 4.0% target in 2019 as a result of moderating global oil prices. bsp is expected to keep its policy rate steady at 4.75% throughout 2019 and will likely prioritize a minimum 2 percentage point reduction of the ratio of required reserves on deposits (rrr) of commercial and universal banks.

against the backdrop of a stabilizing scenario in 2019, the bank is poised to take advantage of the recovery in household and overall spending. with inflation decelerating to within bsp targets, the bank has been prudent and strategic in maximizing the window of favorable loan repricing.
in 2017, there was an intentional slowdown in the bank’s consumer lending business growth to focus on improving internal processes and developing internal systems. in particular, these improvements covered innovative auto and housing loan facilities, highly automated loan processing systems, and prudent risk management. with the new and improved processes in place, the bank is now better equipped to expand its retail loans base, rising to meet the demand for primary homes and vehicles of the growing young middle class. in light of the mid-term election spending, the bank’s newly created business banking segment is ready to service the unique financial needs of the bank’s sme clients, particularly those suppliers of campaign and electoral materials. moreover, the bank’s corporate segment continues to provide a full suite of banking products to large corporates and multinationals, not only to those involved in the government’s build, build, build program.
to manage our exposure to market volatility and currency fluctuation while capturing opportunities, the bank’s treasury arm has various strategies. the foreign exchange desk has been steadily shifting from trading to proprietary flows while the bank’s recent usd bond issuance also allows for a more diverse funding profile to match our clients’ foreign currency needs. the bank’s remittances desk has also introduced new services to complement the overseas filipinos’ natural activity in foreign exchange markets.
in light of the current system liquidity tightness, one of the bank’s top priorities is current account and savings account (casa) growth. to improve casa deposits, a dual-pronged approach will be employed: (1) capitalizing on the bank’s extensive physical and digital distribution network, and (2) continuing to provide innovative deposit-based products to acquire new clients and attract deposits.
branch network expansion will be in key areas where the bank previously has no presence, which show potential for increasing consumer spending and infrastructure investments. this expansion will be balanced and complemented by the outlays in the bank’s digital infrastructure for more efficient digitalized banking processes that will spur financial inclusion in the country.

household consumption and investment spending may continue to drive economic growth in the coming years. the country has a young population that supports consumer demand, thereby preventing a situation similar to aging countries where growth is sluggish. capital spending from the private sector is expected to remain substantial given the need to expand the productive capacity of corporates in order to meet rising consumer demand.
however, a crucial element in the country’s long term development is the improvement in public infrastructure. economic activity will be constrained if transport and logistics costs remain high. the government’s infrastructure initiatives will allow the economy to grow at a faster rate in the long run.
to capitalize on the philippines’ stable economic growth, the bank’s medium term strategic imperatives focus on financial inclusion and digitalization.
the bank’s microfinance arm, banko, was created to contribute to the nation’s prosperity by reaching out to a wider swath of the population, recognizing the need for the unbanked market to have access to credit. primarily a platform to serve self-employed micro-entrepreneurs (semes), the bank has begun to provide these clients with affordable and appropriate financial products and services, and empowering them with financial advice and solutions that promote the growth and expansion of their enterprises.
the bank recognizes the importance of building strong digital capabilities both in digital distribution platforms to exponentially increase client access points, and also in the back office to increase productivity and automation, as well as reduce costs. significant investments have been made in the following key areas: (1) developing an omni-channel experience, (2) providing a 360-degree view of the client, (3) implementing a workforce retraining program, (4) focusing on cybersecurity, and (5) building resiliency. digitalization will be the bank’s core focus over the next five years, with the aim of continuously enhancing overall customer experience, and maintain a cost advantage over other banks in the philippines.",0.8570399880409241,0.04809688776731491,0.09486307203769684
