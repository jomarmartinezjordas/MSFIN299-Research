the philippine economy expanded by 5.6% in 2021 after contracting by 9.6% in 2020. economic activity rebounded amid the easing of restrictions and the improvement in mobility. the availability of vaccines and treatments has contributed to the recovery of consumer confidence. household consumption rose by 4.2% in 2021 as e-commerce continued to expand. the continuous inflow of remittances and the decline in unemployment rate have also provided a boost in consumer spending.

on the other hand, investment spending continues to lag compared to 2019 level but managed to rebound by 19% in 2021. the private sector has been conservative with its capital expenditures amid the uncertainties of the pandemic and the upcoming elections. despite this, imports have already exceeded pre-pandemic level given the demand for raw materials especially semiconductors. exports also posted substantial growth in 2021 amid the global boom in manufacturing.
if the growth momentum is sustained, economic output will likely return to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of 2022. a full year growth of 6.5 to 7.5% is expected in 2022 as vaccination hits 70% of the target population and as the economic activities adjust further to alleviate the impact of covid-19.

inflation was faster in 2021 at 3.9% compared to 2.4% in 2020 (base year 2018) amid supply constraints and improving demand causing the local currency depreciate against the us dollar. looking ahead, favorable base effects could pull down inflation in the first quarter of 2022. however, average inflation in 2022 is still expected to settle near the 4% target of the bsp due to existing and emerging inflationary pressures. oil and electricity prices will likely continue to increase given expectations of higher demand and tighter supply in the global markets. furthermore, global supply chain issues may persist and increase the cost of imported products. the improvement in demand may also exert pressure on consumer prices and may eventually lead to the depreciation of the peso.
as a result, the bsp may need to adjust its policy rate to avoid the de-anchoring of inflationary expectations as the policy rate has remained below inflation for nearly two years. aside from this, an adjustment may be needed as a response to the rate hikes of the federal reserve. expectations of tighter dollar liquidity in the coming months might exert pressure on the peso and the bsp’s dollar reserves if the policy rate is kept at 2.0%.
meanwhile, government borrowing is another factor that could push interest rates higher in 2022. with government revenues still lagging behind expenditures amid the pandemic, the budget deficit will likely remain substantial.

with demand slowly going back to pre-pandemic level, imports will likely exceed exports and remittances in 2022. the increase in dollar demand due to rising imports may provide support to the dollar and cause the peso to weaken. aside from this, rising interest rates in the us may lead to dollar outflows that could drive the depreciation of the peso. expectations of tighter dollar supply due to the bond tapering of the federal reserve may contribute further to this.
