we categorize our capital expenditures as follows:
• domestic backbone which connects the three major philippine islands of luzon, visayas and mindanao in a single continuous loop. the primary luzon, visayas, and mindanao segments were already operational and completed last november 2021, supported by over 20 cable landing stations across the archipelago. the domestic backbone comprises of both outside plant equipment, or passive or not electrically powered network equipment (e.g. fiber), and inside plant equipment, or active or electrically powered network equipment (e.g. routers). we estimate our domestic backbone capital expenditures on a per kilometer basis according to the length of the network that we are planning to develop;
• distribution network, which connects the domestic backbone with the network access points (“naps”), and the ports mounted on the naps. when entering into a new area, rollout capital expenditure is approximately u.s.$100 per port with subsequent augmentation of additional ports costing approximately u.s.$20 per port. we were able to deploy 2.4 million ports in 2021. we construct poles to support our distribution network, particularly where naps are hoisted. until 2023, the majority of our distribution network rollout will be focused on deepening our penetration in luzon. we estimate our distribution network capital expenditures on a per homes passed basis according to the number of homes passed additions that we have targeted. we also estimate the number of additional poles that our distribution network will require and the expected capital expenditure per pole;
• customer premise equipment (“cpe”), which are the modems and routers provided to residential subscribers. the cost for each cpe for a ftth subscriber is approximately u.s.$70, and it is depreciated over three years. the annual cpe cost that we incur is directly correlated to the volume of gross residential subscriber additions in a given year;
• international connectivity, which connects our domestic network with key international networks. we actively seek to form partnerships with global carriers in order to secure proprietary access to bandwidth capacity on certain key international network routes. for example, in august 2020, we entered into an agreement with telstra international limited to purchase 5tbps of international bandwidth capacity, providing a 15-year iru on two major intra-asia networks for an attractive cost. this 5tbps of bandwidth capacity is equivalent to approximately seven times our current leased bandwidth capacity, and has been priced at an aggregate unit cost that is meaningfully lower compared to our average contracted lease costs at present. this iru is subject to certain conditions.
in may 2021, converge secured its participation in the bifrost cable system with the signing of definitive agreements with keppel telecommunications & transportation’s wholly-owned subsidiary, keppel midgard holdings pte. ltd. (“kmh”). the agreement aims to grant converge an iru for one fiber pair on the main trunk of bifrost cable system, which directly connects singapore to the west coast of north america. kmh and converge will also jointly develop a branch on the bifrost cable system that will land in davao, philippines, with converge also being granted an iru on the entire davao branch. the additional branch will significantly increase internet speeds and network diversity for businesses and consumers in the philippines. converge will invest over u.s.$100 million (around p5 billion) for the whole project.
going forward, converge intends to continue to secure proprietary access to international bandwidth capacity through similar agreements with other international carriers, which can provide us with significant cost savings; and
• other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, such as it systems and software.

in 2021, our capital expenditures were allocated as follows:
• 61.5% to our outside plant equipment, or passive or not electrically powered network equipment, related to the construction of our proprietary end-to-end fiber network. these include investments into fiber-optic cables, the construction of our domestic backbone and distribution networks, including the construction of poles, the installation of network access points and ports.
• 20.5% to our inside plant equipment, or active or electrically powered network equipment, related to the construction of our proprietary end-to-end fiber network. this includes dense wavelength division multiplexing (“dwdm”) equipment and routers for activating the network buildout discussed in the outside plant equipment above.
• 12.3% to our customer premises equipment, which are the modems and routers provided to residential subscribers.
• 5.7% to other capex, which include right-of-use assets, intangible assets, transportation and heavy equipment, land, office equipment and furniture, leasehold improvements and tools and facility equipment

we did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that were likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

we are exposed to the market risks in the course of our normal business activities. these market risks principally involve the possibility of adverse consequences on our results of operations due to factors that generally beyond our control. the most important types of risk the company manages are credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
the following parameters pertain to various qualitative and quantitative factors that may affect the operations of the company:
i. there are no other known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will have a material impact on the company’s liquidity.
ii. there are no other known events that will trigger direct or contingent financial obligation that is material to the company, including any default or acceleration of obligation.
iii. there are no material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), and other relationships of the company with unconsolidated entities or other persons created during the reporting period.
iv. the company’s financial performance depends on various risk factors outlined our 2021 annual report under major risk factors and risk management. the company’s business may be affected by these risks. nonetheless, this company takes steps to augment and manage these risks through various means as indicated in our 2021 under major risk factors and risk management.
v. there are no other significant elements of income or loss that did not arise from the company’s continuing operations.
vi. there are no seasonal aspects that may have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations.
