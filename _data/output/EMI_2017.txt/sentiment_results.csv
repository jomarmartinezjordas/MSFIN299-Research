"the group had expanded its geographic footprint both in the philippines and across the globe. from the philippines, it found ground in spain in early 2013 and february 2014, with the acquisition of bodega san bruno and investment in bodega las copas (“blc”), respectively. from spain, business opportunity knocked in uk so the group acquired whyte and mackay (“wmg”) in october 2014. the group returned its sight in spain with the acquisition of brandy and sherry business under bodegas fundador in march 2016 (a deal inked in november 2015) and the acquisition of domecq brandy and wine brand portfolio and related assets in march 2017 (a deal inked in december 2016, and transferred/consolidated to the group in september 2017). these provided platforms for international expansion and domestic premiumization for emperador.
having set the groundworks, emperador moved on to brand investments in 2017.
blc is a joint venture which is accounted for under the equity method.
the group is presented into two segments: scotch whisky (representing the uk operations) and brandy (representing the philippine and spanish operations, including the fundador and domecq operations starting march 2016 and september 2017, respectively).

total revenues reached p42,656 million this year as compared to p41,018 million a year ago, a modest hike of 4.0% attributed to strong sales from offshore subsidiaries.
the scotch whisky segment turned over revenues to external customers higher by 7.2% year- on-year. own scotch whisky labels the dalmore and jura remained to be the growth drivers, with strong sales of core range and rare expressions (dalmore 18, 25, king alexander iii and vintage) in uk, asia, usa, greater europe, latin america and travel retail. more importantly, the biggest market in asia is now the biggest dalmore market in the world. jura, with new bottle and packaging upgrade, has a significant launch of the re-designed range in the us.
the brandy segment on the other hand, turned over revenues to external customers higher by 2.8% year-on-year. spanish brandies fundador, and terry centenario and harveys bristol cream sherry enjoyed a good year, with sales growing in spain, uk and the philippines. it was a challenging year for emperador brandy. total sales of the group improved 4.4% to p42,206 million from p40,447 million a year ago.
other revenues went down 21.3% to p449 million this year due to lower net results from blc which resulted in lower share in net profit recorded for this year, and the foreign exchange gains reported in 2016.

total costs and expenses amounted to p34,820 million this year from p31,582 million a year ago, up 10.2% year-on-year primarily from the brandy business which, including intersegment purchases, increased 14.8% year-on-year.
cost of goods sold
costs increased 8.5% primarily due to higher costs in the brandy segment, which grew faster than sales, while scotch whisky segment’s costs inched 2.2% from a year ago. such increase is attributed to high cost of wine, new bottles and packaging for the new and re/packaged products this year.

gross profit margins (gpm) on consolidated level remained healthy at 35% in 2017 and 37% in 2016. the gpms of the brandy and scotch whisky segments were respectively posted at 35% and 30% in 2017 and 40% and 28% in 2016.
other operating expenses
other operating expenses were up 8.3% to p5,810 million from p5,364 million, mainly due to advertising and promotions which include strategic marketing spends (new products launched this year terry white in spain, shackleton in uk, emperador hotshot and red in philippines), salaries and employee benefits (due to more employees and new positions created) and supplies (uk is changing datalinks network to all locations, which would result in fall in telephone costs in the long run). professional fees went down from brandy business’s professional fees paid in 2016.

other charges swelled 79.4% to p1,425 million from p794 million due to unrealized foreign exchange loss and the interest expense on new loans reported by spain.

as a result of the foregoing, profit before tax ebbed 17.0% to p7,835 million from p9,436 million in 2016.

tax expense was reduced by 13.7% to p1,503 million from p1,742 million a year ago due to lower taxable income.
