"the challenges brought about by the covid-19 pandemic that started in march 2020 has had significant impact on global economy as pandemic restrictions weaken economic conditions in many markets. the group has navigated through these challenges by managing its costs and expenditures; maintaining supply of its products and capitalizing on off-premise and online sales channels while on- premise and travel retail were closed or limited due to lockdowns, travel restrictions and liquor bans.
overall, despite the unprecedented conditions, our business has remained resilient as our operating results in 2020 and 2021 have shown.

the group is presented into two segments: scotch whisky (representing the uk operations) and brandy (representing the philippine and` spanish operations, including the fundador and domecq operations starting march 2016 and september 2017, respectively). blc is a joint venture which is accounted for under the equity method and reported under the brandy segment.

both segments showed sturdy results with scotch whisky segment gaining traction as it took up 1/3 of the revenue pie for the year 2021.

the group performed better in 2021 amidst a still volatile environment4, anchored on the strength of
its diversified portfolio and international operations.
net profit for the year surged 26% year-on-year to a record-high of p10.1 billion, as revenues and other income jumped 6% year-on-year to p55.9 billion. net profit to owners accelerated to p10.0 billion, up 25% year-on-year. gross profit rate (“gpr”) improved to 36% from 31% a year ago, and net profit rate (“npr”) and net profit to owners rate (“npor”) higher at 18% this year as compared to 15% a year ago. normalized net profit [i.e. p0.7 billion non-cash consolidation tax adjustment in 2021 added back] soared 35% to p10.8 billion, of which p 10.6 billion was attributable to owners, up 34% year-on-year.
the brandy segment realized net profit of p7.6 billion during the year, up 31% year-on-year, as it turned over p37.2 billion revenues and other income from external customers, up 1% year-on-year. brandy sales grew year-on-year at both the philippine and international markets, particularly in mexico, spain and usa where restriction on on-trade business have loosened up. ‘emperador’, ‘fundador’, ‘presidente’, and ‘terry’ remained as the top-selling brandy brands, with sales increases registered during the year. sales of ‘harveys bristol cream’ also rose as it sold well in uk. gross profit expanded 24% year-on-year to p12.6 billion with gpr improving to 34% from 28% of a year ago as more of high-margin products were sold in the current year. the higher gp and lower operating costs lifted both np and npo to p7.6 billion and p7.4 billion, respectively, with npr and npor of 20% in the current year as compared to 15% a year ago.
the scotch whisky segment ended the year with p18.7 billion revenues and other income from external customers, a 17% jump year-on-year, with net profit [also its net profit to owners] growing at 14% year-on-year to p2.6 billion. adding back a non-cash deferred tax expense, normalized net profit amounted to p3.2 billion which is up 44% from a year ago, buoyed by its single malt products. single malts ‘dalmore’, ‘jura’, ‘tamnavulin’ and ‘fettercairn’ continued to post double-digit year-on-year growths in net net sales. there were large increases in asia, uk, europe, usa, travel retail, and practically all regions as economies began to bounce back against the pandemic although some countries were re-imposing restrictions in response to new covid variants. uk off-trade and e- commerce continued to grow as demands remained high. gross profit expanded 28% year-on-year to p7.4 billion with gpr improving to 40% from 36% last year as sales grew faster than cost of goods sold due mainly to product sales mix (sales of high-priced/ high-margin products increased). as markets opened up and sales grew, operating expenses increased. the segment ended with npr of 14% and normalized npr of 17% as compared to 14% of last year.

total revenues and other income grew 6% (+p3.1 billion) year-on-year to p55.9 billion in 2021 as compared to p52.8 billion in 2020 as external revenues from scotch whisky segment and from brandy segment grew by 17% (+p2.8 billion) and 1% (+p0.3 billion), respectively. ‘emperador’,
‘fundador’ and ‘el presidente’ remained to be the group’s top selling philippine, spanish and mexican brands, respectively while single malts ‘the dalmore’, ‘jura’ and ‘tamnavulin’ were the group’s top selling scotch whisky brands during the current year.

other income dipped 24%(-p0.3 billion) to p1.1 billion from p1.4 billion a year ago due to lower share in net income of blc, lower foreign exchange gains and lower interest income during the year.

total costs and expenses remained stable at p43.0 billion this year from p43.4 billion a year ago, down 0.8% (-p0.4 billion) year-on-year, as scotch whisky business’ costs and expenses, including intersegment purchases, expanded 11% (+p1.4 billion) and those of brandy business contracted 6% (-p1.8 billion).

costs slid 2% (-p0.6 billion), to p34.8 billion from p35.4 billion a year ago due to product sales mix (sale of high-priced/high-margin products).

gross profit rates on consolidated level improved to 36% in 2021 as compared to 31% in 2020. this is largely attributed to sales growth (+7%) outpacing cost of goods sold (-2%), which is further attributed to sales product mix. the gprs of the brandy and scotch whisky segments were respectively posted at 34% and 40% in 2021 as compared to 28% and 36% in 2020.

interest and other charges increased 89% (+p0.6 billion) to p1.2 billion from p0.6 billion due to higher interest expense and unrealized foreign exchange losses. interest expense increased 43% (+p0.2billion) due to higher variable interest on els (due to 3 dividend declarations) during the year while other charges increased 5times (+p0.3 billion) from unrealized foreign exchange losses.

as a result of the foregoing, profit before tax improved 37% to p12.9 billion from p9.4 billion a year ago.

tax expense went up 96% (+p1.3 billion) to p2.7 billion from p1.4 billion a year ago due to higher taxable income attributed to robust sales and the take-up of p0.7 billion deferred tax adjustment on intangible assets at consolidation level, which was triggered by the increase in corporation tax in uk (effective april 1, 2023)(that received royal assent in june 2021). the said tax adjustment is a non- cash item, does not affect uk stand-alone operating results and will never be paid in the far future unless the uk business is sold or liquidated.
