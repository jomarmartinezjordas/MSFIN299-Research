" full year consolidated service revenues posted a 2% decline from the record level revenues of ₱149.0 billion last year to only ₱146.4 billion in 2020, due mainly to the impact of the pandemic and the extended quarantine restrictions to most business segments except for home broadband. the robust performance of home broadband was offset by mobile, corporate data and fixed line voice, which all registered a decline against last year. the significant growth in data revenue, which accounts for 76% of total service revenues mainly fueled this year’s performance, as millions logged in from home for work, business, education, entertainment, telehealth and other online services.
o mobile business revenues as of end-december of 2020 slid by 7% from nearly ₱111.0 billion last year to ₱103.1 billion this year mainly due to the negative effects of the ecq/mecq period. mobile revenues improved in the second half of the year with higher prepaid top-up levels and postpaid subscriber acquisitions, as the country reopened business activities, bringing back jobs and increasing the mobility of filipinos, albeit below full capacities under gcq/modified gcq.
o buoyed by the robust demand for fast and reliable internet connection, the home broadband business enjoyed a banner year with double-digit growth, posting a 23% year- on-year increase from the ₱21.7 billion posted in 2019 to a record ₱26.8 billion as of end- december of 2020. the outstanding performance of the home broadband business was largely driven by the continued subscriber base expansion and increased demand for
home prepaid wi-fi.
o despite the improvement in corporate data revenues in the fourth quarter, full year
revenues remained lower versus last year at ₱12.5 billion, or 3% year-on-year decline. corporate data’s drop in yearly revenues was attributed to lower domestic and international services, partly cushioned by higher information and communication technology (ict) revenues.
o fixed line voice revenues likewise were lower year-on-year by 2%.
 non-telco products and services, on the other hand, generated a total of p1.3 billion revenues as
of end-december 2020, or up by 99% from last year mostly coming from ecpay and yondu.
 total operating expenses and subsidy as of end-december 2020 amounted to ₱72.9 billion from nearly ₱73.0 billion in 2019. the increases from trade provisions, subsidy, staff costs, rent, and repairs & maintenance were muted by the decline in interconnection fees, utilities and services.
 total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year rose to ₱35.4 billion from ₱34.1 billion reported in 2019, given globe’s continued massive network investments despite the pandemic.
 overall, globe ended the year with total costs and expenses at ₱108.3 billion or 1% higher from ₱107.1 billion a year ago, due to increases across many expense line items except for interconnect costs, utilities and services. higher expenses for the period were mainly to support management strategies, business, and data-network expansion.
 globe’s consolidated ebitda, which totaled ₱73.5 billion, was below last year’s level of ₱76.0 billion mainly due to covid-19 that impacted the topline figures. ebitda margin likewise declined to 50% from last year’s 51%. excluding the one-time additional provisions for doubtful accounts booked in the first half of the year amounting to ₱1.9 billion and the ₱0.7 billion other income, normalized ebitda would have been ₱74.8 billion or 2% lower versus last year. this would have translated to a 51% normalized ebitda margin which is at par compared to 2019.
 non-operating charges grew year-on-year by 21%, due to the one-time impairment loss amounting to ₱4.2 billion largely from the network change out covering the full sunset of the 3g assets and the existing copper infrastructure, as partly offset by the gain of ₱2.4 billion mostly from the deemed sale of investment in mynt following a third-party infusion by bow wave and loan revaluation.
 the globe group ended year with consolidated net income of ₱18.6 billion, sliding by 16% from the reported net income in 2019. this was mainly attributed to the 3% decline in ebitda, 4% increase in depreciation expenses and 21% increase in non-operating charges. excluding the impact of the extraordinary items booked this year, normalized net income would have been ₱20.4 billion, or 8% lower from a year ago.
 globe's core net income, which excludes the impact of non-recurring charges, one-time gain, foreign exchange gains and mark-to-market charges, stood at ₱19.5 billion, down by 13% year- on-year.
 total cash capital expenditures as of end-december 2020 stood at ₱60.3 billion, 18% higher than last year's level of ₱51.0 billion. about 86% of the total capex for the period was spent on data network with the company’s continued focus on increasing capacity, cell site upgrades and fast- track fiberization of filipino homes nationwide for better internet experience.

the globe group ended the year with total operating revenues of ₱160.5 billion, down by 4% from the ₱166.7 billion recorded last year. this was driven by the 2% year-on-year decline in the topline to reach only ₱146.4 billion in 2020 from ₱149.0 billion in 2019. the covid-19 pandemic and the extended quarantine restrictions adversely affected most business segments except for home broadband.
mobile service revenues, which accounted for 70% of globe’s consolidated service revenues for the year just ended, posted a 7% decline at ₱103.1 billion, due to the negative impact of the pandemic.
globe group’s fixed line and home broadband full year 2020 revenues stood at close to ₱42.0 billion, 12% higher year-on-year from ₱37.4 billion in 2019, bolstered by the solid contributions of home broadband.
mobile non-service revenues declined year-on-year by 31%. fixed line and home broadband non- service revenues, however grew significantly compared to last year’s ₱394 million. meanwhile, non- service revenues from non-telco products and services likewise improved from ₱2 million in 2019 vs. ₱91 million in 2020.

mobile data, the biggest contributor to the mobile business, accounted for 70% of total mobile service revenues (vs. 64% in 2019). as of end-december 2020 mobile data revenues posted close to ₱72.0 billion, a slight improvement of 1% versus a year ago. the sustained growth momentum in mobile data revenues was driven by the increasing consumption as the health crisis had turned mobile data into a primary need for filipinos. likewise, data traffic rose given consumers more conscientious data usage boosted by globe’s recalibrated data offers that provided better value and served the changing needs of its customers.

globe closed 2020 with a total mobile subscriber base of 76.6 million, down by 19% from last year coming mostly from the decline in acquisitions given the extended quarantine imposed in the country, coupled with the increase in prepaid churn, as churn levels continue to normalize from the impact of the 1-year load validity regulation. combined, globe prepaid and tm gross acquisitions comprised 99% of acquired sims during the period. with the increase in overall churn rates for the year of 5.4% from 3.3% a year ago, net reduction in subscribers totalled 17.6 million this period from the 20.1 million net additions last year.

globe postpaid arpu registered at ₱850, which was 6% lower from a year ago.

globe’s prepaid segment, which includes the globe prepaid1 and tm brands, accounts for 97% of its total mobile subscriber base. as end-december 2020, cumulative prepaid subscribers stood at about 74.1 million, 19% lower than the 91.5 million subs reported in 2019.
based on the national telecommunications commission (ntc) memorandum circular 03-07-2009, the first expiry periods ranges from 3 days for p10 or below to 120 days for reloads amounting to p300 and above. the second expiry remains at 120 days from the date of the new first expiry periods. the first expiry is reset based on the longest expiry period among current and previous reloads. under this policy, subscribers are included in the subscriber count until churned. under the new pronouncement based on the national telecommunications commission (ntc), department of information and communications technology (dict), and department of trade and industry (dti) joint memorandum circular no. 05-12-2017 all prepaid load will now carry a one-year expiration period regardless of amount.
in compliance to this new regulation, effective january 6, 2018, globe implemented a one-year expiration period for prepaid load worth 300 pesos and above. then on july 5, 2018, globe expanded the implementation to all globe prepaid load, including those with denominations below 300 pesos.
the succeeding sections discuss the performance of the globe prepaid and tm brands in more detail.
a. globe prepaid
globe prepaid gross acquisitions dropped by 32% year-on-year from 25.1 million subscribers last year. total cumulative globe prepaid subscribers was at 38.1 million as of end-december 2020, or 15% drop from a year ago. prepaid churn rate for the period jumped to 4.8% from last year’s 3.1% as the churn continue to normalize from the impact of the 1-year load validity regulation.

b. tm
tm’s gross acquisitions declined year-on-year by 27%, from prior year’s 27.4 million subscribers due to the impact of covid-19 pandemic. total cumulative tm subscribers stood at 36.0 million as of end- december of 2020, or 23% decline from the 46.7 million reported last year. tm churn rate for the period jumped to 6.2% from last year’s 3.5% as the churn rates continue to revert to historical levels.
tm arpu posted a 2% decline from ₱61 reported in 2019.

globe group’s fixed line and home broadband full year 2020 revenues stood at close to ₱42.0 billion, 12% higher year-on-year from ₱37.4 billion in 2019, bolstered by the solid contributions of home broadband.

globe home broadband maintained its momentum by posting a 23% year-on-year revenue growth to reach a record ₱26.8 billion this period, from ₱21.7 billion last year. total home broadband subscriber base now stands at 3.8 million, up 88% from the year earlier, driven mainly by the sustained increase in fixed wireless broadband users, which was up by 122% versus last year. as of end-december of 2020, home prepaid wi-fi (hpw) data traffic soared to 545 petabytes from 115 petabytes in 2019. the outstanding performance of the home broadband business was propelled by the need for reliable broadband connectivity during this time of crisis.

corporate data ended the year with ₱12.5 billion revenues, down by 3% from a year ago, largely coming from domestic and international services as partly mitigated by higher information and communication technology (ict) revenues.

globe’s total fixed line voice revenues however, declined year-on-year by 2%.

both globe and innove offer ild voice services which cover international call services between the philippines to 237 destinations with 780 roaming partners. this service generates revenues from both inbound and outbound international call traffic, with pricing based on agreed international termination rates for inbound traffic revenues and ntc-approved ild rates for outbound traffic revenues.
globe’s ild voice revenues from the mobile and fixed line businesses declined year-on-year by 33% (from ₱5.1 billion in 2019 to only ₱3.4 billion in 2020). this is attributed to the continued migration of international traffic through other internet-based applications.

globe ended the year with total costs and expenses at ₱108.3 billion or 1% higher from ₱ 107.1 billion a year ago, due to increases across many expense line items except for interconnect costs, utilities and services. higher expenses for the period were mainly to support management strategies, business, and data-network expansion.
globe group’s full year interconnect charges significantly declined by 75%, posting only ₱1.0 billion in 2020 from nearly ₱4.0 billion last year. the decrease in interconnection fees was largely due to this year’s non-imposition of interconnect charges1 on mobile domestic voice and sms transactions coupled with lower roaming payout.

marketing and subsidy expenses grew by 18% year-on-year to reach ₱8.7 billion from ₱7.4 billion reported a year ago mostly coming from subsidy and higher spending for ads & promos, as partly cushioned by lower commissions given the decline in postpaid acquisitions.

staff costs were up 3% to nearly ₱16.0 billion in 2020 from ₱15.5 billion in 2019 due to the 4% increase in headcount (8,353 in 2020 vs. 8,048 in 2019), translating to higher salaries and employee-related benefits, combined with the increase in retirement fund and hospitalization insurance, as partly offset by lower incentives this year.

utilities, supplies, and other administrative expenses, which contribute 9% of total operating expenses and subsidy, posted a decline of 4%, totaling to ₱6.3 billion from ₱6.6 billion reported in 2019. the drop was mainly from utilities on lower electricity and local travel. these were partially offset by higher fuel consumption for generator sets and supplies such as covid-19 protective supplies.

rent expenses for the year 2020 was at ₱6.2 billion, up by 7% from a year ago due to expenses related to international cable facilities, ip port, and leases for cell sites, partly cushioned by lower leases for service vehicles and local interconnection facilities. this accounts for 9% of total operating expenses and subsidy.

repairs and maintenance costs for the year stood at ₱9.6 billion, up by 13% from the ₱8.5 billion reported a year ago. this was largely on higher expenditures for communication equipment, supplies facilities’ preventive repairs and international cable system maintenance.

this account includes provisions related to trade, non-trade and traffic receivables and inventory obsolescence. globe group’s provisions significantly grew year-on-year by 38% largely from the additional trade provisions due to the pandemic, as partly countered by lower inventory provisions.

accounting for 26% of total operating expenses and subsidy, services and expenses decreased by 9% from ₱20.9 billion reported in 2019 driven mostly by lower managed services and customer call center services, counterbalanced by higher professional/advisory fees.

total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year rose to ₱35.4 billion from ₱34.1 billion reported in 2019, given globe’s continued massive network investments despite the pandemic.

the globe group’s full year 2020 non-operating charges, increased by 21% from the ₱9.1 billion reported last year to nearly ₱11.0 billion this period. higher non-operating expenses this period was mainly due to the one-time impairment loss amounting to ₱4.2 billion largely from the network change out covering the full sunset of the 3g assets and the existing copper infrastructure, as partly offset by the gain of ₱2.4 billion, mostly from the deemed sale of investment in mynt following a third-party infusion by bow wave and loan revaluation.

globe’s balance sheet and cash flows remain strong with ample liquidity and gearing comfortably within
bank covenants.
globe group’s consolidated assets as of 31 december 2020 amounted to ₱339.8 billion compared to ₱304.3 billion as of december 31, 2019. consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (including investments in assets available for sale and held to maturity investments) was at ₱19.5 billion as of end-december of 2020 compared to ₱8.3 billion as of end-december of 2019.
globe closed 2020 with gross debt to equity ratio on a consolidated basis at 2.02:1 and is still within the 3.0:1 debt to equity limit dictated by globe’s debt covenants. meanwhile, net debt to equity ratio was at 1.79:1 as of end-december 2020 and 1.58:1 as of end december 2019. globe’s current ratio stood at 0.80:1 as of 31 december 2020 and 0.73:1 as of 31 december 2019 which are at par with industry standards. while globe’s average current ratio was below the sec’s minimum of 1:1, globe believes it has more than sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its debt maturities, currently and prospectively.
the financial tests under globe’s loan agreements include compliance with the following ratios:
 total debt* to equity not exceeding 3.0:1;
 total debt to ebitda not exceeding 3.5:1;
 debt service coverage1 exceeding 1.3 times; and
 secured debt ratio2 not exceeding 0.2 times.
as of 31 december 2020, globe is well within the ratios prescribed under its loan agreements.

on july 23, 2020, globe telecom issued a usd 300 million 10-year and usd 300 million 15-year us dollar denominated senior notes with a coupon rate of 2.5% and 3.0%, respectively. the notes are unrated and have been listed on the singapore exchange securities trading limited on july 24, 2020. the net proceeds from the issue of the notes will be used to finance globe’s capital expenditures, maturing and/or existing obligations, and for general corporate requirements.

net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2020 was at ₱65.2 billion, down by 12% from the previous year.
meanwhile, net cash used in investing activities amounting to ₱61.6 billion, was 12% higher from last year. consolidated cash capital expenditures as of end-december 2020 amounted to ₱60.3 billion, or 18% higher from last year’s ₱51.0 billion.

consolidated net cash provided by financing activities amounted to ₱8.5 billion in 2020 versus last year’s net cash used for financing activities of ₱33.3 billion. this was mainly driven by higher proceeds from borrowings as partly offset by increase in repayment of borrowings, and interest payments, coupled with the lease liability payments this period. consolidated total debt, likewise increased by 23% from ₱136.3 billion at the end of december 2019 to ₱167.7 billion at the end of december this year.
96% of us$ consolidated loans have been effectively converted to php via us$963 million in currency hedges. after swaps, effectively 1% of total debt is denominated in us$.

the globe group has available uncommitted short-term credit facilities of ₱16,224 million and usd 84 million, ₱16,350 million and usd 94 million as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively.
the globe group also has available ₱3,000 million committed short-term credit facilities as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019. there is ₱3,500 million and nil long term committed credit facilities as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively.
there are ₱700 million and nil outstanding short-term loans as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively.
stockholders’ equity as of end-december 2020 was higher by 2% from ₱81,247 million to ₱82,804 million this period.

voting preferred stock at a par value of ₱5 per share of which 158.5 million shares are outstanding out of a total authorized of 160 million shares.
the dividends for voting preferred stock are declared upon the sole discretion of the globe telecom’s bod.
to date, none of the voting preferred shares have been converted to common shares.

common shares at par value of ₱50 per share of which 133.4 million are issued and outstanding out of a total authorized of 149 million shares.

the dividend policy of globe telecom as approved by the board of directors is to declare cash dividends to its common stockholders on a regular basis as may be determined by the board. the dividend payout rate is reviewed annually and subsequently each quarter of the year, to take into consideration globe telecom’s operating results, cash flows, debt covenants, capital expenditure levels and liquidity.
on november 8, 2011, the board of directors approved the current dividend policy of globe telecom to distribute cash dividend at the rate of 75% to 90% of prior year’s core net income.
on august 6, 2013, the board of directors further approved the change in distribution from semi-annual dividend payments to quarterly dividend distributions. on december 10, 2013, the bod approved to defer the implementation of the quarterly dividend payout to the third quarter of 2014.
on november 5, 2018, the board of directors likewise approved the proposed change in the dividend policy from 75% to 90% of prior year’s core net income to 60% to 75% of prior year’s core net income, to be applied to the 2019 dividend declaration. the amended policy will provide globe with increased flexibility with respect to capital management. this adjustment will also ensure the sustainability of the operations in this investment-heavy environment, while protecting future dividends, once planned expansion yields beneficial results.
on february 3, 2020, the bod approved the declaration of the first quarter cash dividend of ₱27 per common share, payable to common stockholders of record as of february 17, 2020. total dividends amounting to ₱3.6 billion was paid last march 4, 2020.
on may 4, 2020, the globe board of directors approved the declaration of the second semi-annual cash dividend for holders of its non-voting preferred shares on record as of july 28, 2020. the amount of the cash dividend shall be at a fixed rate of 5.2006% per annum calculated in respect of each share by reference to the offer price of ₱500.00 per share on a 30/360-day basis for the six-month dividend period. total amount of the cash dividend was paid last august 24, 2020.
likewise, the board of directors of globe approved in a separate approval the declaration of two quarterly distributions of cash dividends of p24.83 per common share paid last june 3, 2020 and september 2, 2020 to shareholders on record as of may 18, 2020 and august 17, 2020, respectively. each cash dividend payment total to about ₱3.3 billion. the decision to change the dividend payout for the second and third quarter dividend distribution was an effort to conserve cash, as a healthy balance sheet and strong cashflows are key to managing the challenges brought about by the extended quarantine period.
on november 3, 2020 the board of directors of globe approved the declaration of the fourth quarter cash dividends of ₱31.33 per common share paid last december 3, 2020 to stockholders on record as of november 17, 2020. the fourth quarter cash dividend payment total is about ₱4.2 billion. total common cash dividend distribution as of end-december 2020 amounted to ₱14.4 billion. on the same date, globe bod approved the declaration of the cash dividend for holders of its voting preferred shares paid last december 3, 2020 to shareholders on record as of november 1 7, 2020. the amount of the cash dividend was based on the 2019 benchmark rate of the 3-day average of the 5-year bval* (i.e. average of october 24, 25, 28, 2019) plus 2%. the aggregate dividend payment for the voting preferred shares was about p50.0 million.
on december 11, 2020, the board of directors of globe also approved the declaration and payment of the first semi-annual 2021 cash dividends for the company’s non-voting preferred shareholders on record as of january 27, 2021. the amount of the cash dividend shall be at a fixed rate of 5.2006% per annum calculated in respect of each share by reference to the offer price of ₱500.00 per share on a 30/360-day basis for the six-month dividend period. payment date: february 22, 2021.

consolidated return on average equity (roe) registered at 22.7% as of end-december 2020, compared to 28.9% in 2019 using trailing 12 months net income and based on average equity balances for the year ended. using trailing 12 months core net income, which excludes the effects of non- recurring expenses on net income, return on average equity as of end-december 2020 and 2019 were 23.8% and 29.1% respectively.

accordingly, consolidated basic earnings per common share were ₱135.04 and p162.96, while consolidated diluted earnings per common share were ₱134.40 and ₱162.20 as of end-december 2020 and 2019, respectively.

foreign exchange risks are managed such that usd inflows from operations (transaction exposures) are balanced or offset by the net usd liability position of the company (translation exposures). globe group’s objective is to maintain a position which results in, as close as possible, a neutral effect to the p&l relative to movements in the foreign exchange market.

globe has natural net us$ inflows arising from its operations. consolidated foreign currency-linked revenues1 were at 7% and 8% of total gross service revenues for the periods ended 31 december 2020 and 2019, respectively. in contrast, globe’s foreign-currency linked expenses were at 14% and 12% of total operating expenses for the same periods ended.

due to these net us$ inflows, an appreciation of the peso has a negative impact on globe’s peso ebitda. globe occasionally enters into forward contracts to hedge against a peso appreciation.
there were no outstanding forward usd sale contracts as of december 31, 2020.

globe’s foreign exchange translation exposures result primarily from movements of the philippine peso (php) against the u.s. dollars (usd) with respect to usd-denominated financial assets, usd- denominated financial liabilities and certain usd-denominated revenues. majority of revenues are generated in php, while bulk of capital expenditures are in usd. in addition, 29% of debt as of december 31, 2020 are denominated in usd before taking into account any swap and hedges. after swaps, effectively 1% of total debt is denominated in us$.

as of end-december 2020, the globe group posted a total of ₱1,691 million net foreign exchange gain.
the globe group‘s foreign exchange risk management policy is to maintain a hedged financial position, after taking into account expected usd flows from operations and financing transactions. globe telecom enters into short-term foreign currency forwards and long-term foreign currency swap contracts in order to achieve this target.
as of end-december 2020, globe has us$303 million in cross currency swap contracts which are hedges of the interest and foreign exchange risks of some of our us$ loans maturing in december 2023, august 2024, march 2025, and august 2027. the mtm of the outstanding swap contracts stood at a loss of ₱1,893 million as of end-december 2020.
as of end-december 2020, globe has us$660 million in principal only swap contracts which are hedges of the foreign exchange risks of some of our us$ loans maturing in april 2022, october 2022, july 2025, july 2027 and july 2030. the mtm of the swap contracts stood at a loss of ₱887 million as of end- december 2020.
globe has us$20 million in outstanding forward usd purchase contracts which remain outstanding as of end-december 2020. the mark-to-market of the outstanding forward usd purchase contracts stood at a loss of us$47 million as of end-december 2020.

interest rate exposures are managed via targeted levels of fixed versus floating rate debt that are meant to achieve a balance between cost and volatility. globe’s policy is to maintain between 44-88% of its peso debt in fixed rate, and between 31-62% of its us$ debt in fixed rate.
as of end-december 2020, globe has a total of us$40 million in us$ interest swaps and us$303 million in cross currency swaps that were entered in to contracts to achieve these targets. the us$ swaps fixed some of the company’s outstanding floating rate debts with quarterly payment intervals up to april 2022, october 2022, december 2023, august 2024, march 2025, march 2027 and august 2027.
as of end-december 2020, 85% (excluding short-term debt) of peso debt is fixed, while 91% of usd debt is fixed after swaps.
in 2020, the globe group’s usd fixed rate loans ratio increased to 91% as a result of the issuance of the usd 600 million fixed rate notes.
the mtm of the interest rate swap contracts (not including the currency swap contracts) stood at a loss of ₱54 million as of end-december 2020.

outstanding credit exposures from financial instruments are monitored daily and allowable exposures are reviewed quarterly.
for investments, the globe group does not have investments in foreign securities (bonds, collateralized debt obligations (cdo), collateralized mortgage obligations (cmo), or any instruments linked to the mortgage market in the us). globe’s excess cash is invested in short term bank deposits.
the globe group also does not have any investments or hedging transactions with investment banks. derivative transactions as of the end of the period are with large foreign and local banks. furthermore, the globe group does not have instruments in its portfolio which became inactive in the market nor does the company have any structured notes which require use of judgment for valuation purposes.

the company uses valuation techniques that are commonly used by market participants and that have been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions. the company uses readily observable market yield curves to discount future receipts and payments on the transactions. the net present value of receipts and payments are translated into peso using the foreign exchange rate at time of valuation to arrive at the mark to market value. for derivative instruments with optionality, the company relies on valuation reports of its counterparty banks, which are the company’s best estimates of the close-out value of the transactions.
gains (losses) on derivative instruments represent the net mark-to-market (mtm) gains (losses) on derivative instruments. as of december 31, 2020, the mtm value of the derivatives of the globe group amounted to ₱2,881.26 million while net loss on derivative instruments arising from changes in mtm reflected in the consolidated income statements as of end-december 2020 amounted to ₱1,579.75 million.
to measure riskiness, the company provides a sensitivity analysis of its profit and loss from financial instruments resulting from movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. the interest rate sensitivity estimates the changes to the following p&l items, given an indicated movement in interest rates: (1) interest income, (2) interest expense, (3) mark-to-market of derivative instruments. the foreign exchange sensitivity estimates the p&l impact of a change in the usd/php rate as it specifically pertains to the revaluation of the net unhedged liability position of the company, and foreign exchange derivatives.

on october 10, 2011, the ntc issued memorandum circular no. 02-10-2011 titled interconnection charge for short messaging service requiring all public telecommunication entities to reduce their interconnection charge to each other from ₱0.35 to ₱0.15 per text, which globe telecom complied as early as november 2011. on december 11, 2011, the ntc one stop public assistance center (ospac) filed a complaint against globe telecom, smart and digitel alleging violation of the said mc no. 02-10-2011 and asking for the reduction of sms off-net retail price from p1.00 to p0.80 per text. globe telecom filed its response maintaining the position that the reduction of the sms interconnection charges does not automatically translate to a reduction in the sms retail charge per text.
on november 20, 2012, the ntc rendered a decision directing globe telecom to:
 reduce its regular sms retail rate from p1.00 to not more than ₱0.80;
 refund/reimburse its subscribers the excess charge of ₱0.20; and
 pay a fine of ₱200.00 per day from december 1, 2011 until date of compliance.
on may 7, 2014, ntc denied the motion for reconsideration (mr) filed by globe telecom last december 5, 2012 in relation to the november 20, 2012 decision. globe telecom’s assessment is that globe telecom is in compliance with the ntc memorandum circular no. 02-10-2011. on june 9, 2014, globe telecom filed petition for review of the ntc decision and resolution with the court of appeals (ca).
the ca granted the petition in a resolution dated september 3, 2014 by issuing a 60-day temporary restraining order on the implementation of memorandum circular 02-10-2011 by the ntc. on october 15, 2014, globe telecom posted a surety bond to compensate for possible damages as directed by the ca.
on june 27, 2016, the ca rendered a decision reversing the ntc’s abovementioned decision and resolution requiring telecommunications companies to cut their sms rates and return the excess amount paid by subscribers. the ca said that the ntc order was baseless as there is no showing that the reduction in the sms rate is mandated under mc no. 02-10-2011; there is no showing, either that the present p1.00 per text rate is unreasonable and unjust, as this was not mandated under the memorandum. moreover, under the ntc’s own mc no. 02-05-2008, sms is a value added service (vas) whose rates are deregulated. the respective motions for reconsideration filed by ntc and that of intervenor bayan muna party list (bayan muna) representatives neri javier colmenares and carlos isagani zarate were both denied.
the ntc thus elevated the ca’s ruling to the supreme court (sc) via a petition for review on certiorari dated september 15, 2017.
for its part, bayan muna filed its own petition for review on certiorari of the ca’s decision. on january 4, 2018, globe received a copy of the sc’s resolution dated november 6, 2017, requiring it to comment on said petition of bayan muna. subsequently, on february 21, 2018, globe received a copy of the sc’s resolution dated december 13, 2017 consolidating the petitions for review filed by bayan muna and ntc, and requiring globe to file its comment on the petition for review filed by ntc. thus, on april 2, 2018, globe filed its consolidated comment on both bayan muna and the ntc’s petitions for review. on september 18, 2018, globe received a copy of bayan muna’s consolidated reply to globe’s consolidated comment and digitel and smart’s comment.

globe telecom believes that it did not violate ntc mc no. 02-10-2011 when it did not reduce its sms retail rate from php 1.00 to php 0.80 per text, and hence, would not be obligated to refund its subscribers. however, if it is ultimately decided by the supreme court (in case an appeal is taken thereto by the ntc from the adverse resolution of the ca) that globe telecom is not compliant with said circular, globe may be contingently liable to refund to its subscribers the ₱0.20 difference (between ₱1.00 and ₱0.80 per text) reckoned from november 20, 2012 until said decision by the sc becomes final and executory. management does not have an estimate of the potential claims currently.

on july 23, 2009, the ntc issued ntc memorandum circular (mc) no. 05-07-2009 (guidelines on unit of billing of mobile voice service). the mc provides that the maximum unit of billing for the cellular mobile telephone system (cmts) whether postpaid or prepaid shall be six (6) seconds per pulse. the rate for the first two (2) pulses, or equivalent if lower period per pulse is used, may be higher than the succeeding pulses to recover the cost of the call set-up. subscribers may still opt to be billed on a one (1) minute per pulse basis or to subscribe to unlimited service offerings or any service offerings if they actively and knowingly enroll in the scheme.
on december 28, 2010, the court of appeals (ca) rendered its decision declaring null and void and reversing the decisions of the ntc in the rates applications cases for having been issued in violation of globe telecom and the other carriers’ constitutional and statutory right to due process. however, while the decision is in globe telecom’s favor, there is a provision in the decision that ntc did not violate the right of petitioners to due process when it declared via circular that the per pulse billing scheme shall be the default.
on january 21, 2011, globe telecom and two other telecom carriers, filed their respective motions for partial reconsideration (mr) on the pronouncement that “the per pulse billing scheme shall be the default”. the petitioners and the ntc filed their respective motion for reconsideration, which were all denied by the ca on january 19, 2012.
on march 12, 2012, globe and innove elevated to the supreme court the questioned portions of the decision and resolution of the ca dated december 28, 2010 and its resolution dated january 19, 2012. the other service providers, as well as the ntc, filed their own petitions for review. the adverse parties have filed their comments on each other’s petitions, as well as their replies to each other’s comments. parties were required to file their respective memoranda and globe filed its memorandum on may 25, 2018. the case is now submitted for resolution.

(1) pldt and its affiliate, bonifacio communications corporation (bcc) and innove and globe telecom are in litigation over the right of innove to render services and build telecommunications infrastructure in the bonifacio global city (bgc). in the case filed by innove before the ntc against bcc, pldt and the fort bonifacio development corporation (fbdc), the ntc has issued a cease and desist order preventing bcc from performing further acts to interfere with innove’s installations in the bgc.
on january 21, 2011, bcc and pldt filed with the ca a petition for certiorari and prohibition against the ntc, et al. seeking to annul the order of the ntc dated october 28, 2008 directing bcc, pldt and fbdc to comply with the provisions of ntc mc 05-05-02 and to cease and desist from performing further acts that will prevent innove from implementing and providing telecommunications services in the fort bonifacio global city pursuant to the authorization granted by the ntc. on april 25, 2011, innove communications, filed its comment on the petition.
on august 16, 2011, the ca ruled that the petition against innove and the ntc lacked merit, holding that neither bcc nor pldt could claim the exclusive right to install telecommunications infrastructure and providing telecommunications services within the bgc. thus, the ca denied the petition and dismissed the case. pldt and bcc filed their motions for reconsideration thereto, which the ca denied.
on july 6, 2012, pldt and bcc assailed the ca’s rulings via a petition for review on certiorari with the supreme court. innove and globe filed their comment on said petition on january 14, 2013, to which said petitioners filed their reply on may 21, 2013. the case remains pending with the sc.
meanwhile, a complaint filed by pldt against the ntc, with innove as intervenor, to annul ntc m.c. no. 05-05-2002 on the ground of unconstitutionality awaits pre-trial proceedings in the rtc in quezon city.
(2) in a case filed by bcc against fbdc, globe telecom, and innove before the rtc of pasig, which case sought to enjoin innove from making any further installations in the bgc and claimed damages from all the parties for the breach of the exclusivity of bcc in the area, the court did not issue a tro and has instead scheduled several hearings on the case. the defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of forum shopping and lack of jurisdiction, among others. on march 30, 2012, the rtc of pasig, as prayed for, dismissed the complaint on the aforesaid grounds. the motion for reconsideration filed by bcc on july 20, 2012 remains pending with the trial court.
acquisition by globe telecom and pldt of the entire issued and outstanding shares of vti
in a letter dated june 7, 2016 issued by philippine competition commission (pcc) to globe telecom, pldt, smc and vti regarding the joint notice filed by the aforementioned parties on may 30, 2016, disclosing the acquisition by globe telecom and pldt of the entire issued and outstanding shares of vti, the pcc claims that the notice was deficient in form and substance and concludes that the acquisition cannot be claimed to be deemed approved.
on june 10, 2016, globe telecom formally responded to the letter reiterating that the notice, which sets forth the salient terms and conditions of the transaction, was filed pursuant to and in accordance with memorandum circular no. l6-002 (mc no. l6-002) issued by the pcc. mc no. 16-002 provides that before the implementing rules and regulations for republic act no. 10667 (the philippine competition act of 2015) come into full force and effect, upon filing with the pcc of a notice in which the salient terms and conditions of an acquisition are set forth, the transaction is deemed approved by the pcc and as such, it may no longer be challenged. further, globe telecom clarified in its letter that the supposed deficiency in form and substance of the notice is not a ground to prevent the transaction from being deemed approved. the only exception to the rule that a transaction is deemed approved is when a notice contains false material information. in this regard, globe telecom stated that the notice does not contain any false information.
on june 17, 2016, globe telecom received a copy of the second letter issued by pcc stating that notwithstanding the position of globe telecom, it was ruling that the transaction was still subject for review.
on july 12, 2016, globe telecom asked the ca to stop the government's anti-trust body from reviewing the acquisition of smc's telecommunications business. globe telecom maintains the position that the deal was approved after globe telecom notified the pcc of the transaction and that the anti-trust body violated its own rules by insisting on a review. on the same day, globe telecom filed a petition for mandamus, certiorari and prohibition against the pcc, docketed as ca-g.r. sp no. 146538. on july 25, 2016, the ca, through its 6th division issued a resolution denying globe telecom's application for tro and injunction against pcc's review of the transaction. in the same resolution, however, the ca required the pcc to comment on globe telecom's petition for certiorari and mandamus within 10 days from receipt thereof. the pcc filed said comment on august 8, 2016. in said comment, the pcc prayed that the ?70 billion deal between pldt-globe telecom and san miguel be declared void for pldt and globe telecom's alleged failure to comply with the requirements of the philippine competition act of 2015. the pcc also prayed that the ca direct globe telecom to: cease and desist from further implementing its co-acquisition of the san miguel telecommunications assets; undo all acts consummated pursuant to said acquisition; and pay the appropriate administrative penalties that may be imposed by the pcc under the philippine competition act for the illegal consummation of the subject acquisition.
meanwhile, pldt filed a similar petition with the ca, docketed as ca g.r. sp no. 146528, which was raffled off to its 12th division. on august 26, 2016, pldt secured a tro from said court. thereafter, globe telecom's petition was consolidated with that of pldt, before the 12th division. the consolidation effectively extended the benefit of pldt's tro to globe telecom. the parties were required to submit their respective memoranda, after which, the case shall be deemed submitted for resolution.
on february 17, 2017, the ca issued a resolution denying pcc's motion for reconsideration dated september 14, 2016 for lack of merit. in the same resolution, the court granted pldt's urgent motion for the issuance of a gag order and ordered the pcc to remove the offending publication from its website and also to obey the sub judice rule and refrain from making any further public pronouncements regarding the transaction while the case remains pending. the court also reminded the other parties, pldt and globe, to likewise observe the sub judice rule. for this purpose, the court issued its gag order admonishing all the parties ""to refrain, cease and desist from issuing public comments and statements that would violate the sub judice rule and subject them to indirect contempt of court. the parties were also required to comment within ten days from receipt of the resolution, on the motion for leave to intervene, and admit the petition-in intervention dated february 7, 2017 filed by citizenwatch, a non-stock and non-profit association.
on april 18, 2017, pcc filed a petition before the sc docketed as g.r. no. 230798, to lift the ca's order that has prevented the review of the sale of san miguel corp.'s telecommunications unit to pldt inc. and globe telecom. on april 25, 2017, globe filed before the sc a motion for intervention with motion to dismiss the petition filed by the pcc.
as of june 30, 2017, the sc did not issue any tro on the pcc's petition to lift the injunction issued by the ca. hence, the pcc remains barred from reviewing the smc deal.
on july 26, 2017, globe received the sc en banc resolution granting globe's extremely urgent motion to intervene. in the same resolution, the supreme court treated as comment, globe's motion to dismiss with opposition ad cautelam to pcc's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or tro.
on august 31, 2017, globe received another resolution of the sc en banc, requiring the pcc to file a consolidated reply to the comments respectively filed by globe and pldt, within ten (10) days from notice. globe has yet to receive the consolidated reply of pcc since the latter requested for extension of time to file the same.
in the meantime, in a decision dated october 18, 2017, the ca, in ca-g.r. sp no. 146528 and ca-g.r. sp no. 146538, granted globe and pldts petition to permanently enjoin and prohibiting pcc from reviewing the acquisition and compelling the pcc to recognize the same as deemed approved. pcc elevated the case to the sc via petition for review on certiorari.
