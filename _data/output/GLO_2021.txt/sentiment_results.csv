"full-year consolidated service revenues grew 4% to a record ?151.5 billion from the ?146.4 billion reported in 2020, due to the sustained outstanding performance of home broadband as well as corporate data. the significant growth in data revenue, which accounts for 80% of total service revenues mainly fueled this year's performance, given the growing demand for high-speed, reliable and affordable internet connectivity for work, business, education, entertainment, telehealth and other online services.
mobile business revenues registered a 1% increase year-on-year at ?104.4 billion from last year's revenue of ?103.7 billion given higher prepaid top ups and acquisitions for the year. revenues in the fourth quarter was also softened by the destruction of the super typhoon that hit the country last december, directly through its impact on subscribers and businesses in the affected areas.
home broadband service revenues in the fourth quarter stood at ?7.0 billion, 11% lower than last quarter due to lower hpw top up and the impact of the rebates given to the affected subscribers in the visayas and mindanao region caused by the recent typhoon. despite the decline in the fourth quarter, home broadband revenues ended 2021 with a new record-high revenues of ?29.4 billion or up a strong 10% from 2020. the sustained growth of the home broadband business was largely driven by stronger demand for reliable and high-speed broadband connectivity due to the prolonged effects of the pandemic. the aggressive fiber rollout in 2021 likewise resulted to an increased take up of ftth lines of 208% and fiber revenues growing by 183% against a year ago.
corporate data revenues for the full-year 2021 remain high at ?14.2 billion, or up 12% year- on-year. this was mainly attributed to higher domestic services, coupled with increase coming from information and communication technology (ict) revenues. higher ict revenues this period was largely from business application services and cloud solutions.
fixed line voice revenues was lower year-on-year by 13%, coming from lower outbound usages and monthly service fees (msf).
non-telco products and services, on the other hand, generated a total of ?1.3 billion revenues as of end-december 2021, or up by 105% from last year mostly coming from ecpay.
total operating expenses and subsidy as of end-december 2021 amounted to ₱76.6 billion from ₱72.9 billion in 2020, or up by 5% due mainly to the increases coming from many expense line items except for subsidy, lease and provisions.
combined with the rebates given to broadband customers and the impairment costs from network related damages, typhoon odette’s pre-tax impact on fourth quarter operations totaled ₱2.2 billion.
total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year rose to ₱41.1 billion from ₱35.4 billion reported in 2020, given globe’s continued massive network investments despite the pandemic.
overall, globe ended the year 2021 with total costs and expenses of ₱117.7 billion or 9% higher from ₱108.3 billion a year ago. higher expenses for the year were mainly to support management strategies, business, and data-network expansion as well as the restoration efforts due to typhoon odette's onslaught.
globe’s consolidated ebitda, which totaled ₱74.9 billion, improved by 2% from last year’s level of ₱73.5 billion mainly due to healthy topline figures this period. ebitda margin on the other hand, slightly declined to 49% from last year’s 50%. however, adjusted for the effects of typhoon odette on revenues and operating expenses, ebitda margin would have remained at 50%.
non-operating charges dropped year-on-year by 57%, owing to the one-time gain of ₱4.3 billion from the deemed sale of investment in mynt, upside impact of create law in vega, and higher equity share in affiliates. this was partly offset by the impairment costs amounting to ₱1.2 billion from the network related damages due to typhoon odette.
the globe group ended the year 2021 with consolidated net income of ₱23.7 billion, jumping by 27% from the reported net income in 2020. this was mainly attributed to the 2% increase in ebitda, and the 57% decline in non-operating charges which fully offset the 16% increase in depreciation expenses. excluding the impact of the extraordinary items booked this year, including the create1 impact, normalized net income would have been ₱19.4 billion, or down by 15% from 2020.
globe's core net income, which excludes the impact of non-recurring charges, one-time gain, foreign exchange gains and mark-to-market charges, stood at ₱21.2 billion, up by 9% year-on-year.
total capex as of end-december 2021 stood at ₱92.8 billion, significantly higher by 54% from last year's level of ₱60.3 billion. about 86% of the total capex for the period was spent on the data network with the company’s continued focus on increasing capacity, cell site upgrades and fast- track fiberization of filipino homes nationwide for a better internet experience.

the globe group ended the year with total operating revenues of ₱167.7 billion, up by 5% from the ₱160.5 billion recorded last year. this was driven by the 4% year-on-year improvement in the topline to reach ₱151.5 billion in 2021 from ₱146.4 billion in 2020. home broadband and corporate data drove the topline expansion given the increased data consumption among the filipinos for work, education, health care, daily commercial transactions, entertainment and essential social interactions.
mobile service revenues, which accounted for 69% of globe’s consolidated service revenues for the year just ended, was relatively stable versus last year, improving by 1% at ₱104.4 billion largely from higher prepaid top ups and higher acquisitions for the year.
globe group’s fixed line and home broadband full year 2021 revenues stood at ₱45.8 billion, 9% higher year-on-year from ₱42.0 billion in 2020, bolstered by the solid contributions of home broadband and corporate data.
mobile non-service revenues increased year-on-year by 26%. fixed line and home broadband non- service revenues, however, declined significantly compared to last year’s ₱2.0 billion. meanwhile, non- service revenues from non-telco products and services likewise improved from ₱31 million in 2020 vs. ₱69 million in 2021.

over the years, globe has pioneered efforts in introducing products and services that cater to the customer’s digital preferences, enabling globe to be the preferred brand for filipinos’ digital lifestyle choices. this was done through collaborative partnerships with global giants in the world of content. the company partnered with internet giant google to provide free access to google mobile services and to provide its subscribers the ability to charge purchases of applications to their postpaid bill or prepaid load, bypassing the need for credit cards and enhancing the convenience for globe and tm customers. likewise, the company was able to tailor-make lifestyle packages for all its subscribers to meet their social networking needs and crowd-sourced content (via facebook and wattpad), chatting and digital communication (viber), music (spotify), sports (nba) and media. moreover, globe's array of content partners including premium online streaming platforms like netflix, iflix, hbo go; social media networks such as youtube; online shopping sites; and mobile games usher in a whole new entertainment experience, made more relevant at this time when most filipinos are staying at home.

volte stands for voice over lte. it's a technology that lets you make voice calls over the lte network, rather than the 2g and 3g networks which we normally use. vowifi, or voice over wi-fi, stands for wi-fi calling which is a complementary technology to volte and lets you make voice calls over a wi- fi network.
volte or vowifi can be used even if the called party doesn’t have a volte-capable device. calls between volte/vowifi - volte/vowifi will have a long-beep ringtone, similar to idd calls. for calls between volte or vowifi and 3g/2g, the call will have the normal ringtone. volte and vowifi are being implemented in phases and is now available in key areas starting december 18, 2020.

globe group’s fixed line and home broadband full-year 2021 revenues stood at ₱45.8 billion, 9% higher year-on-year from ₱42.0 billion in 2020, bolstered by the solid contributions of home broadband and corporate data.
globe home broadband maintained its momentum by posting a 10% year-on-year revenue growth to reach a new record high of ₱29.4 billion this period, from ₱26.8 billion last year. total home broadband subscriber base now stands at 3.7 million. as of end-december of 2021, home prepaid wi-fi (hpw) data traffic soared to 808 petabytes from 545 petabytes in 2020. the outstanding performance of the home broadband business was propelled by the need for reliable and high-speed broadband connectivity due to the prolonged effects of the global health crisis. this stellar performance was also achieved notwithstanding the fourth quarter was partly muted by the impact of rebates given to the affected subscribers in the typhoon odette-stricken areas, coupled with lower spending on telco products on these areas as most customers reserved their money for contingencies.

corporate data ended the year with ₱14.2 billion revenues, or 12% higher from a year ago, largely coming from domestic services coupled with higher information and communication technology (ict) revenues. higher ict revenues was mainly from business application services and cloud solutions.

globe’s total fixed line voice revenues however, declined year-on-year by 13%.

both globe and innove offer ild voice services which cover international call services between the philippines to 237 destinations with 781 roaming partners. this service generates revenues from both inbound and outbound international call traffic, with pricing based on agreed international termination rates for inbound traffic revenues and ntc-approved ild rates for outbound traffic revenues.
globe’s ild voice revenues from the mobile and fixed line businesses declined year-on-year by 28% (from ₱3.2 billion in 2020 to only ₱2.3 billion in 2021). this is attributed to the continued migration of international traffic through other internet-based applications.

globe ended the year with total costs and expenses at ₱117.7 billion or 9% higher from ₱ 108.3 billion a year ago, due to increases across many expense line items except for subsidy, lease and provisions. higher expenses for the period were mainly to support management strategies, business, and data- network expansion as well as the restoration efforts due to typhoon odette's onslaught.

globe group’s full year interconnect charges grew by 17%, posting ₱1.2 billion in 2021 from ₱1.0 billion last year. the increase came mostly from application to person (a2p) domestic sms payout and outbound roaming usages and voip.

marketing and subsidy expenses slightly increased by 1% year-on-year to reach ₱8.8 billion from ₱8.7 billion reported a year ago due to this year’s increase in merchandising materials, events, airtime & place time ads, and direct marketing expenses. lower 2020 marketing spending was driven by deferral of marketing programs and campaigns due to the pandemic.

staff costs were up 14% at ₱18.2 billion in 2021 from ₱16.0 billion in 2020 due to higher average headcount.

utilities, supplies, and other administrative expenses, which contribute 10% of total operating expenses and subsidy, rose by 19%, totaling to ₱7.5 billion from ₱6.3 billion reported in 2020. higher electricity usage was mainly due to new sites and powergen consumption.

lease expense in 2021 dropped by 31% to reach only ₱4.3 billion this period from ₱6.2 billion a year ago, due to lower cell site leases on short term non-cancellable lease contracts now accounted for using right-of-use (rou) model. lease expenses accounts for 6% of total operating expenses and subsidy.

repairs and maintenance costs for the year stood at ₱10.2 billion, up by 6% from the ₱9.6 billion reported a year ago. this was largely coming from subscriber line maintenance, national transmission maintenance as well as increased spending on preventive and corrective maintenance.

this account includes provisions related to trade, non-trade and traffic receivables and inventory obsolescence. globe group’s provisions significantly dropped year-on-year by 27% largely from trade provisions. last year’s higher trade provisions was mainly due to accumulated uncollected receivables from subscribers affected by the pandemic.

accounting for 29% of total operating expenses and subsidy, services and expenses went up by 15% from ₱19.1 billion reported in 2020. this was largely from subscriber line installation services, cloud and security services, partly offset by lower professional/advisory fees. other expenses also showed increase mostly from merchant discount charges, miscellaneous bank charges, ntc spectrum fees and other taxes and licenses.

total depreciation and amortization expenses for the year rose to ₱41.1 billion from ₱35.4 billion reported in 2020, given globe’s massive network rollout, upgrades/modernization and cell site acquisition.

the globe group’s full year 2021 non-operating charges, declined by 57% from the ₱11.0 billion reported last year to only ₱4.7 billion this period. lower non-operating expenses this period was mainly due to the gain of ₱4.3 billion from the deemed sale of investment in mynt, coupled with the upside impact of create law in vega and higher equity share in affiliates. this was partly offset by the impairment costs amounting to ₱1.2 billion from the network related damages caused by typhoon odette.

globe’s balance sheet and cash flows remain strong with ample liquidity and gearing comfortably within bank covenants.
globe group’s consolidated assets as of 31 december 2021 amounted to ₱458.5 billion compared to ₱339.8 billion as of december 31, 2020. consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (including investments in assets available for sale and held to maturity investments) was at ₱24.2 billion as of end-december of 2021 compared to ₱19.5 billion as of end-december of 2020.
globe closed 2021 with gross debt to equity ratio on a consolidated basis at 1.84:1 and is still within the 3.0:1 debt to equity limit dictated by globe’s debt covenants. meanwhile, net debt to equity ratio was at 1.62:1 as of end-december 2021 and 1.79:1 as of end december 2020. globe’s current ratio stood at 0.58:1 as of 31 december 2021 and 0.80:1 as of 31 december 2020 which are at par with industry standards. while globe’s average current ratio was below the sec’s minimum of 1:1, globe believes it has more than sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its debt maturities, currently and prospectively.
the financial tests under globe’s loan agreements include compliance with the following ratios:

total debt* to equity not exceeding 3.0:1;
total debt to ebitda not exceeding 3.5:1;
total debt service coverage1 exceeding 1.3 times; and secured debt ratio2 not exceeding 0.2 times.
*composed of notes payable, current portion long-term debt, long term debt and net derivative liabilities
as of 31 december 2021, globe is well within the ratios prescribed under its loan agreements.

net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2021 was at ₱65.1 billion, or flat versus the previous year.
meanwhile, net cash used in investing activities amounting to ₱96.6 billion, was 57% higher from last year. consolidated cash capital expenditures as of end-december 2021 amounted to nearly ₱92.8 billion, or 54% higher from last year’s ₱60.3 billion.

consolidated net cash provided by financing activities amounted to ₱36.1 billion in 2021, higher versus last year’s ₱8.5 billion. this was mainly driven by higher proceeds from borrowings and issuance of capital securities as partly offset by increase in repayment of borrowings, dividends, redemption of preferred shares and interest payments, coupled with the lease liability payments this period.
consolidated total debt, likewise increased by 25% from ₱167.7 billion at the end of december 2020 to ₱210.1 billion at the end of december of 2021.
100% of us$ consolidated loans have been effectively converted to php via us$1,091 million in currency hedges. after swaps, effectively none of the total debt is denominated in us$.

the dividend policy of globe telecom as approved by the board of directors is to declare cash dividends to its common stockholders on a regular basis as may be determined by the board. the dividend payout rate is reviewed annually and subsequently each quarter of the year, to take into consideration globe telecom’s operating results, cash flows, debt covenants, capital expenditure levels and liquidity.
on november 8, 2011, the board of directors approved the current dividend policy of globe telecom to distribute cash dividend at the rate of 75% to 90% of prior year’s core net income.
on august 6, 2013, the board of directors further approved the change in distribution from semi-annual dividend payments to quarterly dividend distributions. on december 10, 2013, the bod approved to defer the implementation of the quarterly dividend payout to the third quarter of 2014.
on november 5, 2018, the board of directors likewise approved the proposed change in the dividend policy from 75% to 90% of prior year’s core net income to 60% to 75% of prior year’s core net income, to be applied to the 2019 dividend declaration. the amended policy will provide globe with increased flexibility with respect to capital management. this adjustment will also ensure the sustainability of the operations in this investment-heavy environment, while protecting future dividends, once planned expansion yields beneficial results.
the board of directors of globe approved in separate approvals the declaration of the quarterly distributions of cash dividends of ₱27 per share, paid each last march 11, 2021, june 4, 2021, september 3, 2021 and december 10, 2021. each cash dividend payment total to about ₱3.6 billion, bringing total distribution by end of december 2021 to ₱14.4 billion.
on may 6, 2021, the globe board of directors also approved the declaration of the second semi-annual cash dividend for holders of its non-voting preferred shares on record as of july 28, 2021. the amount of the cash dividend was at a fixed rate of 5.2006% per annum calculated in respect of each share by reference to the offer price of p500.00 per share on a 30/360-day basis for the six-month dividend period. total amount of the cash dividend was paid last august 23, 2021. likewise, on the same date, the board of directors ratified the resolutions of globe’s finance committee approving the company's redemption of series a non-voting perpetual preferred shares (glopp). the redemption was made last august 22, 2021 (the 7th year anniversary from the issue date of the shares) by payment in cash of the redemption price equal to the issue price of the shares plus accrued and unpaid dividends up until august 22, 2021 based on the dividend rate of 5.2006% per annum. as the redemption date falls on a sunday, the payment of the redeemed shares was made last august 23, 2021 to shareholders on record as of july 28, 2021. trading suspension of glopp was july 23, 2021, which was also the ex- date. the shares were recorded as treasury stock of globe until the shares are retired.

consolidated return on average equity (roe) registered at 24.1% as of end-december 2021, compared to 22.7% in 2020 using trailing 12 months net income and based on average equity balances for the year ended. using trailing 12 months core net income, which excludes the effects of non- recurring expenses on net income, return on average equity as of end-december 2021 and 2020 were 21.5% and 23.8% respectively.
accordingly, consolidated basic earnings per common share were ₱173.18 and ₱135.04, while consolidated diluted earnings per common share were ₱172.25 and ₱134.40 as of end-december 2021 and 2020, respectively.


foreign exchange risks are managed such that usd inflows from operations (transaction exposures) are balanced or offset by the net usd liability position of the company (translation exposures). globe group’s objective is to maintain a position which results in, as close as possible, a neutral effect to the p&l relative to movements in the foreign exchange market.

globe has natural net us$ inflows arising from its operations. consolidated foreign currency-linked revenues1 were at 6% and 7% of total gross service revenues for the periods ended 31 december 2021 and 2020, respectively. in contrast, globe’s foreign-currency linked expenses were at 17% and 14% of total operating expenses for the same periods ended.

due to these net us$ inflows, an appreciation of the peso has a negative impact on globe’s peso ebitda. globe occasionally enters into forward contracts to hedge against a peso appreciation.

globe’s foreign exchange translation exposures result primarily from movements of the philippine peso (php) against the u.s. dollars (usd) with respect to usd-denominated financial assets, usd- denominated financial liabilities and certain usd-denominated revenues. majority of revenues are generated in php, while bulk of capital expenditures are in usd. in addition, 26% of debt as of december 31, 2021 are denominated in usd before taking into account any swap and hedges. after swaps, effectively none of the total debt is denominated in us$.

as of end-december 2021, the globe group posted a total of ₱3,656 million net foreign exchange losses.
the globe group‘s foreign exchange risk management policy is to maintain a hedged financial position, after taking into account expected usd flows from operations and financing transactions. globe telecom enters into short-term foreign currency forwards and long-term foreign currency swap contracts in order to achieve this target.
as of end-december 2021, globe has us$299 million in cross currency swap contracts which are hedges of the interest and foreign exchange risks of some of our us$ loans maturing in december 2023, august 2024, march 2025, march 2027 and august 2027. the mtm of the outstanding swap contracts stood at a loss of ₱115 million as of end-december 2021.
as of end-december 2021, globe has us$752 million in principal only swap contracts which are hedges of the foreign exchange risks of some of our us$ loans maturing in april 2022, october 2022, may 2023, july 2025, may 2027, july 2027 and july 2030. the mtm of the swap contracts stood at a gain of ₱1,849 million as of end-december 2021.
globe has us$205 million short-term fx swap contracts which remain outstanding as of end-december 2021. the mark-to-market of the outstanding fx swap contracts stood at a gain of ₱169 million as of end-december 2021.
globe has us$239 million in outstanding forward usd sale / purchase contracts which remain outstanding as of end-december 2021. the mark-to-market of the outstanding forward usd sale / purchase contracts stood at a loss of ₱83 million as of end-december 2021.

interest rate exposures are managed via targeted levels of fixed versus floating rate debt that are meant to achieve a balance between cost and volatility. globe’s policy is to maintain between 44-88% of its peso debt in fixed rate, and between 31-62% of its us$ debt in fixed rate.
as of end-december 2021, globe has a total of us$33 million in us$ interest swaps and us$299 million in cross currency swaps that were entered into contracts to achieve these targets. the us$ swaps fixed some of the company’s outstanding floating rate debts with quarterly payment intervals up to april 2022, october 2022, december 2023, august 2024, march 2025, march 2027 and august 2027.
as of end-december 2021, 86% (excluding short-term debt) of peso debt is fixed, while 80% of usd debt is fixed after swaps.
in 2020, the globe group’s usd fixed rate loans ratio increased to 91% as a result of the issuance of the usd 600 million fixed rate notes.
the mtm of the interest rate swap contracts (not including the currency swap contracts) stood at a loss of ₱14 million as of end-december 2021.

outstanding credit exposures from financial instruments are monitored daily and allowable exposures are reviewed quarterly.
for investments, the globe group does not have investments in foreign securities (bonds, collateralized debt obligations (cdo), collateralized mortgage obligations (cmo), or any instruments linked to the mortgage market in the us). globe’s excess cash is invested in short term bank deposits.
the globe group also does not have any investments or hedging transactions with investment banks. derivative transactions as of the end of the period are with large foreign and local banks. furthermore, the globe group does not have instruments in its portfolio which became inactive in the market nor does the company have any structured notes which require use of judgment for valuation purposes.

the company uses valuation techniques that are commonly used by market participants and that have been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions. the company uses readily observable market yield curves to discount future receipts and payments on the transactions. the net present value of receipts and payments are translated into peso using the foreign exchange rate at time of valuation to arrive at the mark to market value. for derivative instruments with optionality, the company relies on valuation reports of its counterparty banks, which are the company’s best estimates of the close-out value of the transactions.
gains (losses) on derivative instruments represent the net mark-to-market (mtm) gains (losses) on derivative instruments. as of december 31, 2021, the mtm value of the derivatives of the globe group amounted to ₱1,805.8 million while net gain on derivative instruments arising from changes in mtm reflected in the consolidated income statements as of end-december 2021 amounted to ₱3,214.6 million.
to measure riskiness, the company provides a sensitivity analysis of its profit and loss from financial instruments resulting from movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. the interest rate sensitivity estimates the changes to the following p&l items, given an indicated movement in interest rates: (1) interest income, (2) interest expense, (3) mark-to-market of derivative instruments. the foreign exchange sensitivity estimates the p&l impact of a change in the usd/php rate as it specifically pertains to the revaluation of the net unhedged liability position of the company, and foreign exchange derivatives.

the globe group is contingently liable for various claims arising in the ordinary conduct of business and certain tax assessments which are either pending decisions by the courts or are being contested, the outcome of which are not presently determinable. in the opinion of management and legal counsel, the possibility of outflow of economic resources to settle the contingent liability is remote.

on october 10, 2011, the ntc issued memorandum circular (mc) no. 02-10-2011 titled interconnection charge for short messaging service requiring all public telecommunication entities to reduce their interconnection charge to each other from ₱0.35 to ₱0.15 per text, which globe telecom complied as early as november 2011. on december 11, 2011, the ntc one stop public assistance center (ospac) filed a complaint against globe telecom, smart and digitel alleging violation of the said mc no. 02-10-2011 and asking for the reduction of sms off-net retail price from ₱1.00 to ₱0.80 per text. globe telecom filed its response maintaining the position that the reduction of the sms interconnection charges does not automatically translate to a reduction in the sms retail charge per text.

on november 20, 2012, the ntc rendered a decision directing globe telecom to:
reduce its regular sms retail rate from p1.00 to not more than ₱0.80;
refund/reimburse its subscribers the excess charge of ₱0.20; and
pay a fine of ₱200.00 per day from december 1, 2011 until date of compliance.

on may 7, 2014, ntc denied the motion for reconsideration (mr) filed by globe telecom last december 5, 2012 in relation to the november 20, 2012 decision. globe telecom’s assessment is that globe telecom is in compliance with the ntc memorandum circular no. 02-10-2011. on june 9, 2014, globe telecom filed petition for review of the ntc decision and resolution with the court of appeals (ca).
the ca granted the petition in a resolution dated september 3, 2014 by issuing a 60-day temporary restraining order on the implementation of memorandum circular 02-10-2011 by the ntc. on october 15, 2014, globe telecom posted a surety bond to compensate for possible damages as directed by the ca.
on june 27, 2016, the ca rendered a decision reversing the ntc’s abovementioned decision and resolution requiring telecommunications companies to cut their sms rates and return the excess amount paid by subscribers. the ca said that the ntc order was baseless as there is no showing that the reduction in the sms rate is mandated under mc no. 02-10-2011; there is no showing, either that the present p1.00 per text rate is unreasonable and unjust, as this was not mandated under the memorandum. moreover, under the ntc’s own mc no. 02-05-2008, sms is a value-added service (vas) whose rates are deregulated. the respective motions for reconsideration filed by ntc and that of intervenor bayan muna party list (bayan muna) representatives neri javier colmenares and carlos isagani zarate were both denied.
the ntc thus elevated the ca’s ruling to the supreme court (sc) via a petition for review on certiorari dated september 15, 2017.
for its part, bayan muna filed its own petition for review on certiorari of the ca’s decision. on january 4, 2018, globe received a copy of the sc’s resolution dated november 6, 2017, requiring it to comment on said petition of bayan muna. subsequently, on february 21, 2018, globe received a copy of the sc’s resolution dated december 13, 2017 consolidating the petitions for review filed by bayan muna and ntc, and requiring globe to file its comment on the petition for review filed by ntc. thus, on april 2, 2018, globe filed its consolidated comment on both bayan muna and the ntc’s petitions for review. on september 18, 2018, globe received a copy of bayan muna’s consolidated reply to globe’s consolidated comment and digitel and smart’s comment.
globe telecom believes that it did not violate ntc mc no. 02-10-2011 when it did not reduce its sms retail rate from php 1.00 to php 0.80 per text, and hence, would not be obligated to refund its subscribers. however, if it is ultimately decided by the supreme court (in case an appeal is taken thereto by the ntc from the adverse resolution of the ca) that globe telecom is not compliant with said circular, globe may be contingently liable to refund to its subscribers the ₱0.20 difference (between ₱1.00 and ₱0.80 per text) reckoned from november 20, 2012 until said decision by the sc becomes final and executory. management does not have an estimate of the potential claims currently.

on july 23, 2009, the ntc issued ntc mc no. 05-07-2009 (guidelines on unit of billing of mobile voice service). the mc provides that the maximum unit of billing for the cellular mobile telephone system (cmts) whether postpaid or prepaid shall be six (6) seconds per pulse. the rate for the first two (2) pulses, or equivalent if lower period per pulse is used, may be higher than the succeeding pulses to recover the cost of the call set-up. subscribers may still opt to be billed on a one (1) minute per pulse basis or to subscribe to unlimited service offerings or any service offerings if they actively and knowingly enroll in the scheme.
on december 28, 2010, the court of appeals (ca) rendered its decision declaring null and void and reversing the decisions of the ntc in the rates applications cases for having been issued in violation of globe telecom and the other carriers’ constitutional and statutory right to due process. however, while the decision is in globe telecom’s favor, there is a provision in the decision that ntc did not violate the right of petitioners to due process when it declared via circular that the per pulse billing scheme shall be the default.
on january 21, 2011, globe telecom and two other telecom carriers, filed their respective motions for partial reconsideration (mr) on the pronouncement that “the per pulse billing scheme shall be the default”. the petitioners and the ntc filed their respective motion for reconsideration, which were all denied by the ca on january 19, 2012.
on march 12, 2012, globe and innove elevated to the supreme court the questioned portions of the decision and resolution of the ca dated december 28, 2010 and its resolution dated january 19, 2012. the other service providers, as well as the ntc, filed their own petitions for review. the adverse parties have filed their comments on each other’s petitions, as well as their replies to each other’s comments. parties were required to file their respective memoranda and globe filed its memorandum on may 25, 2018. the case is now submitted for resolution.

 pldt and its affiliate, bonifacio communications corporation (bcc) and innove and globe telecom are in litigation over the right of innove to render services and build telecommunications infrastructure in the bonifacio global city (bgc). in the case filed by innove before the ntc against bcc, pldt and the fort bonifacio development corporation (fbdc), the ntc has issued a cease and desist order preventing bcc from performing further acts to interfere with innove’s installations in the bgc.
on january 21, 2011, bcc and pldt filed with the ca a petition for certiorari and prohibition against the ntc, et al. seeking to annul the order of the ntc dated october 28, 2008 directing bcc, pldt and fbdc to comply with the provisions of ntc mc 05-05-02 and to cease and desist from performing further acts that will prevent innove from implementing and providing telecommunications services in the fort bonifacio global city pursuant to the authorization granted by the ntc. on april 25, 2011, innove communications, filed its comment on the petition.
on august 16, 2011, the ca ruled that the petition against innove and the ntc lacked merit, holding that neither bcc nor pldt could claim the exclusive right to install telecommunications infrastructure and providing telecommunications services within the bgc. thus, the ca denied the petition and dismissed the case. pldt and bcc filed their motions for reconsideration thereto, which the ca denied.
on july 6, 2012, pldt and bcc assailed the ca’s rulings via a petition for review on certiorari with the supreme court. innove and globe filed their comment on said petition on january 14, 2013, to which said petitioners filed their reply on may 21, 2013. on 22 december 2021, innove filed its memorandum with the supreme court in compliance with said court’s resolution dated 06 october 2021.
meanwhile, a complaint filed by pldt against the ntc, with innove as intervenor, to annul ntc m.c. no. 05-05-2002 on the ground of unconstitutionality awaits pre-trial proceedings in the rtc in quezon city. in a motion to dismiss dated january 8, 2021, however, a copy of which was received by innove on january 12, 2021, pldt informed the trial court that “upon re-evaluation of intervening events since pldt filed its complaint, it no longer intends to pursue its complaint and prays for its dismissal without prejudice.” the motion to dismiss awaits the trial court’s resolution.
 in a case filed by bcc against fbdc, globe telecom, and innove before the rtc in taguig, which case sought to enjoin innove from making any further installations in the bgc and claimed damages from all the parties for the breach of the exclusivity of bcc in the area, the court did not issue a tro and has instead scheduled several hearings on the case. the defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of forum shopping and lack of jurisdiction, among others. on march 30, 2012, the rtc, as prayed for, dismissed the complaint on the aforesaid grounds. on april 27, 2015, the trial court denied bcc’s motion for reconsideration. thereafter, or on november 3, 2020, bcc filed a notice of appeal with said court. however, in a notice of withdrawal of appeal dated january 7, 2021 which was received by globe and innove on january 12, 2021, bcc informed the trial court that it was no longer pursuing its appeal “after careful consideration of the intervening events since the filing of the complaint” and asked that it be allowed to withdraw its appeal. the motion for withdrawal of appeal remains pending with the trial court.

in a letter dated june 7, 2016 issued by philippine competition commission (pcc) to globe telecom, pldt, smc and vti regarding the joint notice filed by the aforementioned parties on may 30, 2016, disclosing the acquisition by globe telecom and pldt of the entire issued and outstanding shares of vti, the pcc claims that the notice was deficient in form and substance and concludes that the acquisition cannot be claimed to be deemed approved.
on june 10, 2016, globe telecom formally responded to the letter reiterating that the notice, which sets forth the salient terms and conditions of the transaction, was filed pursuant to and in accordance with mc no. l6-002 issued by the pcc. mc no. 16-002 provides that before the implementing rules and regulations for ra no. 10667 (the philippine competition act of 2015) come into full force and effect, upon filing with the pcc of a notice in which the salient terms and conditions of an acquisition are set forth, the transaction is deemed approved by the pcc and as such, it may no longer be challenged. further, globe telecom clarified in its letter that the supposed deficiency in form and substance of the notice is not a ground to prevent the transaction from being deemed approved. the only exception to the rule that a transaction is deemed approved is when a notice contains false material information. in this regard, globe telecom stated that the notice does not contain any false information.
on june 17, 2016, globe telecom received a copy of the second letter issued by pcc stating that notwithstanding the position of globe telecom, it was ruling that the transaction was still subject for review.
on july 12, 2016, globe telecom asked the ca to stop the government's anti-trust body from reviewing the acquisition of smc's telecommunications business. globe telecom maintains the position that the deal was approved after globe telecom notified the pcc of the transaction and that the anti-trust body violated its own rules by insisting on a review. on the same day, globe telecom filed a petition for mandamus, certiorari and prohibition against the pcc, docketed as ca-g.r. sp no. 146538. on july 25, 2016, the ca, through its 6th division issued a resolution denying globe telecom’s application for tro and injunction against pcc’s review of the transaction. in the same resolution, however, the ca required the pcc to comment on globe telecom's petition for certiorari and mandamus within 10 days from receipt thereof. the pcc filed said comment on august 8, 2016. in said comment, the pcc prayed that the ₱70.00 billion deal between pldt-globe telecom and san miguel be declared void for pldt and globe telecom’s alleged failure to comply with the requirements of the philippine competition act of 2015. the pcc also prayed that the ca direct globe telecom to: cease and desist from further implementing its co-acquisition of the san miguel telecommunications assets; undo all acts consummated pursuant to said acquisition; and pay the appropriate administrative penalties that may be imposed by the pcc under the philippine competition act for the illegal consummation of the subject acquisition.
meanwhile, pldt filed a similar petition with the ca, docketed as ca g.r. sp no. 146528, which was raffled off to its 12th division. on august 26, 2016, pldt secured a tro from said court. thereafter, globe telecom’s petition was consolidated with that of pldt, before the 12th division. the consolidation effectively extended the benefit of pldt’s tro to globe telecom. the parties were required to submit their respective memoranda, after which, the case shall be deemed submitted for resolution.
on february 17, 2017, the ca issued a resolution denying pcc’s motion for reconsideration dated september 14, 2016 for lack of merit. in the same resolution, the court granted pldt’s urgent motion for the issuance of a gag order and ordered the pcc to remove the offending publication from its website and also to obey the sub judice rule and refrain from making any further public pronouncements regarding the transaction while the case remains pending. the court also reminded the other parties, pldt and globe, to likewise observe the sub judice rule. for this purpose, the court issued its gag order admonishing all the parties “to refrain, cease and desist from issuing public comments and statements that would violate the sub judice rule and subject them to indirect contempt of court. the parties were also required to comment within ten days from receipt of the resolution, on the motion for leave to intervene, and admit the petition-in intervention dated february 7, 2017 filed by citizenwatch, a non-stock and non-profit association.

as of june 30, 2017, the sc did not issue any tro on the pcc's petition to lift the injunction issued by the ca. hence, the pcc remains barred from reviewing the smc deal.
on july 26, 2017, globe received the sc en banc resolution granting globe's extremely urgent motion to intervene. in the same resolution, the supreme court treated as comment, globe's motion to dismiss with opposition ad cautelam to pcc's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or tro.
on august 31, 2017, globe received another resolution of the sc en banc, requiring the pcc to file a consolidated reply to the comments respectively filed by globe and pldt, within ten (10) days from notice. globe has yet to receive the consolidated reply of pcc since the latter requested for extension of time to file the same.

in the meantime, in a decision dated october 18, 2017, the ca, in ca-g.r. sp no. 146528 and ca-g.r. sp no. 146538, granted globe and pldts petition to permanently enjoin and prohibiting pcc from reviewing the acquisition and compelling the pcc to recognize the same as deemed approved. pcc elevated the case to the sc via petition for review on certiorari.

in 2021, globe continued to implement a full work from home (wfh) arrangement with a skeletal workforce for critical roles (csf) as part of its efforts to secure the health and safety of its employees. with national covid case numbers on a downward trend in the fourth quarter of 2021 and with the vaccines becoming accessible to more filipinos, globe had started to plan for the return to office (rto) of its wfh employees and ramping up operations for csf as early as november 2021. then to implement a hybrid work arrangement where employees will report to the office at least 3 times a week beginning february 1, 2022. however, towards the end of november 2021 the omicron variant was detected in south africa. this new variant reached philippine shores in early january 2022, with the holiday season becoming the avenue to spread the virus among filipinos. this resulted in a new wave of infections that led to the philippine government declaring alert level 3, first in metro manila and key cities, then to other parts of the country. with the rising cases among employees and their families, globe decided to postpone the rto plan to secure employee health and safety. the wfh/csf arrangement will continue to be in effect, and the rto plan will be revisited by management once the situation improves. globe commits to monitor the covid situation in the country, and implement safeguards to ensure that the company will be able to continue to deliver its commitment in providing telecom services to its customers, while reducing risk of infections among its workforce
