in 2020, tmp maintained its auto dealership complement of 71 outlets with no new openings for the year.
the overall financial performance of tmp was largely driven by the taal eruption and the community quarantine restrictions in 2020. decline in demand for vehicles caused net income to drop from php9.1 billion in 2019 to php3.3 billion in 2020. other than lower vehicle sales, the overall slowdown in the economy also affected consumer behavior with some households deferring vehicle purchases or opting for lower-priced models. on the contrary, we have seen improved demand for passenger cars as public modes of transport became limited, shifting the overall mix to smaller and lower-priced models. also, demand for spare parts declined in line with the economic contraction. these drivers were offset by favorable forex movement as the us dollar remained weak over the year.

new business from life insurance expressed in annualized premium equivalent declined by 23.6% from php6.8 billion in 2019 to php5.2 billion in 2020. such was driven by the 36.3% decline in regular premium, partially offset by the 55.3% growth in single premium. the lower sales production was attributable to the limited mobility of agents and lower foot traffic in banks as an effect of the quarantine restrictions. premium revenues increased by 19.1% from php26.5 billion in 2019 to php31.6 billion in 2020 as the premium revenue mix changed from 36%/64% (single premium vs. regular premium) in 2019 to 46%/54% in 2020. by distribution platform, bancassurance, sales agency and corporate solutions accounted for 63%, 33% and 4% of premium revenues, respectively.

consolidated net income grew by 22.4% from php2.4 billion in 2019 to php2.9 billion in 2020. the improvement in consolidated net income is attributable to non-life insurance business which reported a net income of php0.1 billion in 2020 from a net loss of php1.0 billion in 2019 due to lower claims and losses, reinsurance cost and management expenses. conversely, axa philippines’s net income declined from php3.4 billion in 2019 to php2.8 billion in 2020 due to lower premium margins from the shortfall in sales in regular premium products and unrealized losses in equity investments.

mpic’s share in the consolidated operating core income decreased by 26% from php20.9 billion in 2019 to php15.4 billion in 2020, owing largely to the economic contraction brought about by the quarantine restrictions. specifically, the decline was driven by the following:
• reduced traffic on toll roads; core net income contribution of metro pacific tollways corporation (mptc) to mpic was php2.4 billion;
• mandated suspension and subsequent reduction in ridership capacity for light rail services; light rail manila corporation (lrmc) contributed a net loss of php0.3 billion to mpic;
• decreased commercial and industrial demand for power and water; mpic’s power business, which includes manila electric company (meralco) and global business power corporation (gbpc) contributed php10.5 billion while maynilad water services (maynilad) and metropac water (mpw) contributed php3.1 billion; and,
• lower share in the earnings of the hospital business after the sell-down of interest to kkr & co. in 2019.
reported net income attributable to equity holders declined by 80% from php23.9 billion in 2019 to php4.7 billion in 2020 due to impairment losses in meralco’s investment in pacific light power and mpic’s investment in landco pacific, and interest accretion on provision for over-recoveries. excluding non-recurring income or expenses, mpic reported a core income of php10.2 billion in 2020 from php15.6 billion in 2019.
