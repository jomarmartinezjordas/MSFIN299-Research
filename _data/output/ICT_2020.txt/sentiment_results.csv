on march 11, 2020, the world health organization has declared the novel coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak a global pandemic.
in the philippines, in a move to contain the covid-19 outbreak, the office of the president of the philippines issued a memorandum directive on march 13, 2020 to impose stringent social distancing measures in the national capital region effective march 15, 2020. on march 16, 2020, presidential proclamation no. 929 was issued, declaring a state of calamity throughout the philippines for a period of six (6) months and imposed an enhanced community quarantine (ecq) throughout the island of luzon until april 12, 2020, which was extended to april 30, 2020. through several extensions continuing as of march 2, 2021, metro manila and certain areas of the country were placed under different categories of community quarantine depending on the risk classification of the area.
likewise, government authorities in other countries where the group operates, adopted measures, including lockdowns, to control the spread of the virus and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.

these measures have caused disruptions to businesses, global supply chain, and economic activities, and its impact continues to evolve.
the scale and duration of these developments remain uncertain as of the report date. the group observed declines in general business, including container throughput and revenues. it is not possible to estimate the overall impact of the outbreak’s near-term and longer effects, however, the group has already incurred and will continue to incur costs as the group continues to mitigate the adverse impact of the outbreak on its operations.
the covid-19 pandemic does not have significant impact to the collectability of the group’s trade receivables in 2020. the customers’ payment terms were not extended due to the pandemic. the overdue trade receivables however increased in the first two months of strict community lockdowns but have greatly improved in the succeeding months and the good momentum was sustained up to december 31, 2020. considering the evolving nature of this pandemic, the group will continue to monitor the situation. uncertainties in market trends and economic conditions may persist due to covid-19 pandemic, which may impact actual results and differ materially from the estimates of expected credit losses.

ictsi and its subsidiaries’ geographically diverse operations expose the group to various market risks, particularly foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, which movements may materially impact the financial results of the group. the importance of managing these risks has significantly increased in light of the heightened volatility in both the philippine and international financial markets.
with a view to managing these risks, the group has incorporated a financial risk management function in its organization, particularly in the treasury operations.

the group has geographically diverse operations and transacts in currencies other than its functional currency. consequently, the group is exposed to the risk of fluctuation of the exchange rates between the us dollar and other local currencies such as php, aud, brl, mxn and eur that may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position. the group attempts to match its revenues and expenses whenever possible and, from time to time, engages in hedging activities to mitigate residual exposures. changes in exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the group’s revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies.
the group’s non-us dollar currency-linked revenues was 51.0 percent and 51.8 percent of gross revenues for the periods ended december 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. foreign currency-linked revenues include the following: (1) arrastre charges of mict; and (2) non-us dollar revenues of international subsidiaries. ictsi incurs expenses in foreign currency for the operating and start up requirements of its international subsidiaries. concession fees payable to port authorities in certain countries are either denominated in or linked to the us dollar.

the group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates (cash flow interest rate risk) relates primarily to the group’s bank loans and is addressed by a periodic review of the group’s debt mix with the objective of reducing interest cost and maximizing available loan terms. the group also enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

the group manages its liquidity profile to be able to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through internally generated cash and proceeds from debt and/or equity. as part of the liquidity risk management, the group maintains strict control of its cash and makes sure that excess cash held by subsidiaries are up streamed timely to the parent company. the group also monitors the receivables and payables turnover to ensure that these are at optimal levels. in addition, it regularly evaluates its projected and actual cash flow information and continually assesses the conditions in the financial market to pursue fund raising initiatives. these initiatives may include accessing bank loans, project finance facilities and the debt capital markets.
ictsi monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank credit facilities deemed adequate to finance the group’s operations, ensure continuity of funding and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.
there are no other known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will materially affect the company’s liquidity.
