ictsi and its subsidiaries’ geographically diverse operations expose the group to various market risks, particularly foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, which movements may materially impact the financial results of the group. the importance of managing these risks has significantly increased in light of the heightened volatility in both the philippine and international financial markets.
with a view to managing these risks, the group has incorporated a financial risk management function in its organization, particularly in the treasury operations.

the group has geographically diverse operations and transacts in currencies other than its functional currency. consequently, the group is exposed to the risk of fluctuation of the exchange rates between the us dollar and other local currencies such as php, aud, brl, mxn and eur that may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position. the group attempts to match its revenues and expenses whenever possible and, from time to time, engages in hedging activities. changes in exchange rates affect the us dollar value of the group’s revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies. the group also enters into cross currency swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the net investments in its subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies.
the group’s non-us dollar currency-linked revenues was 51.8 percent and 55.3 percent of gross revenues for the periods ended december 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. foreign currency-linked revenues include the following: (1) arrastre charges of mict; and (2) non-us dollar revenues of international subsidiaries. ictsi incurs expenses in foreign currency for the operating and start up requirements of its international subsidiaries. concession fees payable to port authorities in certain countries are either denominated in or linked to the us dollar.

the group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates (cash flow interest rate risk) relates primarily to the group’s bank loans and is addressed by a periodic review of the group’s debt mix with the objective of reducing interest cost and maximizing available loan terms. the group also enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

the group manages its liquidity profile to be able to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through internally generated cash and proceeds from debt and/or equity. as part of the liquidity risk management, the group maintains strict control of its cash and makes sure that excess cash held by subsidiaries are up streamed timely to the parent company. the group also monitors the receivables and payables turnover to ensure that these are at optimal levels. in addition, it regularly evaluates its projected and actual cash flow information and continually assesses the conditions in the financial market to pursue fund raising initiatives. these initiatives may include accessing bank loans, project finance facilities and the debt capital markets.
ictsi monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank credit facilities deemed adequate to finance the group’s operations, ensure continuity of funding and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.
there are no other known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will materially affect the company’s liquidity.",0.6307511329650879,0.35895827412605286,0.010290538892149925
