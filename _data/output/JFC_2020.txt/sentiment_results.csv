consolidated revenues decreased by p50,313.2 million or 28.0% to p129,313.0 million for the year 2020, primarily as a result of permanent closure of stores and lower sales per store due to the covid-19 pandemic. the negative impact of foreign currency translation was less than 1%.

sws is the group’s measure for all sales to consumers, both from group-owned and franchised stores. consolidated sws decreased by p67,821.9 million or 27.8 per cent, from p243,792.2 million for 2019 to p175,970.3 million for 2020.

as at march 31, 2020, the group had 5,974 jfc group-owned and franchised stores globally, of which 50% were temporarily closed due to the covid-19 pandemic. as covid-19 pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions were gradually lifted in april, may, june, and july 2020, jfc reopened more stores and the percentage of stores that were temporarily closed was reduced to 40%, 26%, 12% and 10% as of april 30 and may 30, 2020, june 30, 2020 and july 31, 2020, respectively. on august 4 to 18, 2020, some parts of the philippines went back to modified enhanced community quarantine resulting in higher temporary closure of domestic stores from 8% as of july 31, 2020 to 10% as of august 31, 2020. in september, october, november and december 2020, jfc reopened more stores and the percentage of stores that were temporarily closed was reduced to 7%, 6%, 5% and 4%, respectively.
