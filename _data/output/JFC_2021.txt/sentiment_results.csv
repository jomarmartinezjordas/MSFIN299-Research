food service operations have both peak and lean seasons. historically, sales in the second and fourth quarters are strong due to the summer and the christmas seasons, respectively. demand during the first and third quarters usually slackens. the material financial impact of this seasonality has been considered in the jfc group’s consolidated financial forecast.
