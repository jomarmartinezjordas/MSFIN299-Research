"jg summit’s portfolio diversity cushions covid’s impact on fy20 core net income. jg summit holdings, inc., one of the largest and highly-diversified conglomerates in the philippines, ended 2020 with core net income after taxes of 450 million given the resiliency of its portfolio and the group’s agile response to the disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic.the double-digit revenue growth in its banking and office segments, robust sales in food, and higher dividends from its telecommunications investment, tempered the negative impact of the pandemic to the group’s overall operating results. its petrochemical unit saw lower sales volumes and selling prices on the back of weaker global industrial demand while its air transport business was severely impacted by flight restrictions particularly in the onset of the enhanced community quarantine (ecq). equity earnings from its core investments in meralco (mer), global business power corporation (gbpc) and united industrial corporation (uic) also declined year-on-year (yoy). thus, jg summit’s consolidated revenues for the full year ending december 31, 2020 (fy20) amounted to 221.6 billion, 27% lower vs the same period last year (sply).the strong margin expansion in its food and banking units also provided some buffer to offset profit declines in other businesses. incorporating nonrecurring fuel hedging losses and a one-off impairment charge from mer led jg summit to report a consolidated net loss of 468 million. (excluding cebu air, inc., which operates in one the most affected industries globally, jg summit’s revenues, core net income after tax and net income would have only declined 8%, 21%,and 42%, to

assets and derivative instruments amounted to 2.3 billion in 2020 from a market valuation gain of 640 million in 2019 attributable to the decline in market values of the group’s financial assets at

2020.the group recognized a net foreign exchange gain of 2.6 billion in 2020 from 829 million foreign exchange loss in 2019 driven by the appreciation of philippine peso vs u.s. dollar in respect to our dollar-denominated long-term debt. other income (expense) - net account, which represents miscellaneous income and expenses, amounted to a loss of 632 million in 2020 mainly due to ceb’s loss on

2020 from p15.0 billion reported in 2019.urc’s finance costs consist mainly of interest expense, which decreased by 229.0 million to 1.4 billion in 2020 from p1.7 billion recorded in 2019 due to lower

the 77.6%decline in passenger volume from 22.5 million to 5.0 million driven by lesser number of flights by70.9% coupled with a 10.5 ppts decrease in seat load factor from 86.4% to 75.9%. lower

3, 2020, ceb signed a deed of absolute sale of its 35% shareholding in siaengineering (philippines) corporation (siaep) to siaec which resulted to a gain on disposal of 34.5 million. as of december 31, 2020, ceb no longer has any equity interest in siaep. onpthe same date, ceb acquired siaec’s 51% interest in a-plus, making the latter a whollysubsidiary of ceb. the recognition of the investment

to 22.2 billion, a decrease of 343.8% from the p9.12 billion net income earned in 2019.petrochemicals (jgspg - consist of jgspc and jgsoc) ended 2020 with full year revenues of 21.3 billion, 27% lower vs sply. the global implementation of strict quarantines negativelypaffected both local demand and exports, which in turn led to lower petrochemical prices yoy.nonetheless, demand started to recover in the second half of the year as domestic customerscautiously restarted operations and as more countries reopened from lockdowns. despite localmarket contraction in 2020, jgspg managed to increase its polymer volume sales by 14% yoyand gained market share as jgspg capitalized on resilient demand for flexible, basic film andagricultural packaging requirements. meanwhile, lower naphtha prices lifted margins and ledjgspg to report an ebitda of 451 million in 2020. but higher depreciation resulted in a netloss of 2.0 billion.jgspg is nearing the final stages of its us$1.1 billion expansion project with some of its keycomponents coming online in the second quarter of 2021. this would improve overallprofitability as the company captures more margins downstream.banking services generated banking revenue of 9.2 billion in 2020, a 13% increase from lastyear’s 8.1 billion mainly driven by an 8% increase in loans, as well as the 939.0 million gainfrom trading activities. despite booking 1.1 billion in provisions for bad loans, the strongtopline growth and the 76-basis point net interest margin improvement led to a net income of 935.0 million, a 30% growth. the bank’s non-performing loan ratio of 2.98% as of end-2020premained lower than industry average amidst the risks posed by the pandemic. rbank alsoaccelerated its digitalization and customer-centric initiatives including

beenexponential growth in its electronic funds’ transfers via instapay and pesonet, in line with theincreased adoption of e-payments and shift towards digital commerce caused by the pandemic.equity in net earnings of associated companies and joint ventures amounted to 7.6 billionfor the year ended december 31, 2020, a 43% decrease from last year’s 13.4 billion. thedecline was mainly driven by the absence of the 3.0 billion gain from uic’s marina mandarintransaction in 2019 and jg summit’s 1.3 billion share in mer’s impairment loss on its pacificlight power investment in 2020. mer and gbpc also
