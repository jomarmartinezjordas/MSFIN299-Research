apart from the focus on sustaining and increasing market relevance through continuous improvement in customer experience, operational efficiency and people development, metrobank is deepening its commitment to instilling financial discipline across new and underserved markets, and exploring venues outside its current csr activities by which it can increase its socio economic impact.

the bank will continue to actively improve on the group's strong capital position. the bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise tier 1 and tier 2 capital. the bank also has had a series of measures to prepare for basel iii implementation.
in 2006, the bank issued us$125.0 million hybrid tier 1 capital security in february and 173,618,400 common shares at p38.00 per common share in october. in may 2010, the bank raised an additional p5.0 billion in capital through a private placement of common shares. in january 2011, the bank raised approximately us$220.0 million through a rights offer for 200 million common shares at the offer price of p50.00 per rights share. in august 2013, the bank increased its capital stock from p50 billion to p100 billion and on september 16, 2013 and issued a stock dividend equivalent to 633,415,805 common shares (with a par value of p20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock, which further improved the bank’s capital position. in april 2015, the bank raised p32.0 billion through a rights offer for 435,371,720 common shares with par value of p20.00 priced at p73.50 per share. the newly issued shares were listed on the pse on april 7, 2015. further, in april 2018, the bank raised p60.0 billion through a rights offer for 799,842,250 common shares with par value of p20.00 priced at p75.00 per share. the newly issued shares were listed on the pse on april 12, 2018.
the bank also issued tier 2 instruments to boost its capital adequacy ratio. the bank issued basel ii compliant tier 2 subordinated notes in october 2007 for p8.5 billion with a coupon of 7.0%; in october 2008 for p5.5 billion with a coupon of 7.75%; and in may 2009 for p4.5 billion with a coupon of 7.5%. with the advent of basel iii, the bank subsequently redeemed these previously issued subordinated debt issuances as they would not have been considered as capital beginning january 1, 2014. the bank exercised the call option on its p8.5 billion 7.0%; p5.5 billion 7.75% and p4.5 billion 7.5% lower tier 2 notes on october 22, 2012, october 4, 2013 and may 6, 2014, respectively. the early redemptions of these instruments were in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes when they were originally issued. by redeeming the notes, the bank avoided a step-up in the interest rate and the capital decay from the instruments. in 2014, the bank raised a total of p22.5 billion in subordinated debt wherein p16.0 billion was issued on march 27, 2014 at a coupon rate of 5.375% and p6.5 billion on august 8, 2014 at 5.25%. the terms of the notes contain a loss absorption feature, allowing them to be recognized as bank capital in accordance with basel iii standards. the transactions were done in part to replace the basel ii tier 2 notes which were redeemed on their call option dates.
basel iii penalizes banks for their holdings in non-allied undertakings. as such, during the period 2012-2016, the group has actively sought to divest itself of such undertakings and strengthen its standing under basel iii. these transactions included the sale of the bank’s ownership in toyota motor philippines corporation in tranches between 2012 and 2013 as well as the sale of fmic’s holdings in global business power corporation in tranches between 2013 and 2016 and fmic’s holdings in charter ping an insurance corporation in 2014. in 2014, the bank and psbank also disposed of its holdings in toyota financial services philippines corporation. altogether, these sales further improved the bank’s car position under basel iii. the group continues to review its holdings in non-allied undertakings and may consider selling additional stakes as necessary.

the philippines remained a dynamic performer in the region, consistently posting above 6% growth since 2016. the economy grew by an average of 6.2% in 2018, the third fastest expansion in the asean region including china, on the back of sustained pickup in government spending, strong investment spending, and solid services sector.
2018 saw domestic consumer prices rise to its highest level in nine years amid the impact of rice supply disruptions and volatile global crude oil prices. inflation, which averaged at 5.2% in 2018 compared to 2.9% in 2017, was largely influenced by the heavily-weighted food index that experienced supply bottlenecks. global oil prices, on the other hand, were on a steady climb since the start of the year and reached its peak in october, with wti and brent crude hitting $75 per barrel and $85 per barrel, respectively. expectation of a modest global economic growth in 2019 is seen to underpin softer global commodity prices.
consequently, interest rates were on a slow rise amid the upside pressure on inflation and in anticipation of subsequent us fed rate hikes. the us federal reserve raised the federal funds rate four times in 2018 on the back of an improving economy and labor market. the bsp, meanwhile, hiked policy rates five times, raising rates by a total of 175 basis points to address the second-round impact of inflation.
the philippine peso, like other emerging market currencies, was on a depreciation trend since the start of the year, weighed down by significant risk events like widening current account deficit, us fed rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions.
following a robust expansion in 2017, the global economy managed to cap 2018 on a still solid footing. for most of the year, the performance of many major economies has been strong while some emerging economies faced headwinds. the us economy continued to show improving fundamentals, while the eurozone posted solid growth in the first half of the year. a number of emerging economies, on the other hand, experienced some setbacks as reflected by sharp currency depreciations. nevertheless, economic dynamics in asia were fairly solid, supported by strong labor markets and robust domestic demand. risks to the outlook, however, continue to mount, especially stemming from the escalating us-china trade conflict.
in the domestic front, the continuous increases in government and investment spending should keep growth above the 6% level. sustained infrastructure outlays will continue to underpin the expansion in investment spending. the government’s infra program will open more opportunities for the private sector to expand business activities and increase capital spending. furthermore, consumption spending is expected to be higher in 2019 amid the continued easing in inflation.

to ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. based on this system of monitoring, the bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. as of december 31, 2018, the contractual maturity profile shows that the bank has at its disposal about p918.10 billion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. this will cover 71.22% of the p1.29 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. these cash inflows exclude securities booked in fvtpl and fvoci whose maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 77.07% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. on the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

in the normal course of the group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. no material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.

for the year 2019, the bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about p2.0 to p4.0 billion, of which 50% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.

standards issued but not yet effective up to date of issuance of the group’s financial statements are listed in note 2 of the audited financial statements of the group as presented in exhibit 4. the listing consists of standards and interpretations issued, which the group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. the group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. except as otherwise indicated, the group does not expect the adoption of these new and amended pfrs and philippine interpretations to have significant impact on its financial statements. the group will assess impact of these amendments on its financial position or performance when they become effective.
