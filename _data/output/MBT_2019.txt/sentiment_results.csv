the bank will continue to actively improve on the group's strong capital position. the bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise tier 1 and tier 2 capital.

as part of the group’s capital efficiency initiatives, the group has been active in optimizing its allied and non-allied undertakings. among the initiatives include the sale of the bank’s ownership in toyota motor philippines corporation in tranches between 2012 and 2013 as well as the sale of fmic’s holdings in global business power corporation in tranches between 2013 and 2016 and fmic’s holdings in charter ping an insurance corporation in 2014. in 2014, the bank and psbank also disposed of its holdings in toyota financial services philippines corporation. altogether, these sales further improved the bank’s capital adequacy under basel iii. as discussed in part i - business item number 2 “description of business-business of registrant”, on march 13, 2019, the respective bods of the bank and mcc approved the proposal to merge mcc into the bank. the proposed merger was ratified by the stockholders of the bank on april 24, 2019, approved by the bsp on october 23, 2019, and approved by the sec on january 3, 2020.
as of december 31, 2019, the group’s capital adequacy ratio (car) and common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio are 17.49% and 16.19%, respectively, both well above the regulatory requirements.

philippine economic growth capped 2019 still above the 6% level as fourth quarter growth came in at 6.4%. full-year average real gdp growth is at 5.9% from 6.2% in 2018. despite the full-year average coming in short of the government’s target for the year, the economy still managed to post a solid growth in the last quarter even amid the negative developments in the global economy during the period and despite the sustained slowdowns in some of its asean peers. the expansion in the fourth quarter could be mainly attributed to accelerated government expenditures, solid household spending, vibrant service sector, and tempered net trade drag.
full-year average inflation came in lower at 2.5% compared to 5.2% in 2018 on the back of sustained easing in the prices key food items, especially rice, and stable global crude oil prices. the rice tariffication law helped bring down domestic rice prices, while brent crude stayed in the $60 per barrel level through most of the year.
consequently, domestic interest rates also declined on improving liquidity condition, benign inflation expectations, and subsequent policy rate cuts from the us federal reserve and the bsp. the fed slashed the federal funds rate three times in 2019 to support the us economy, while the bsp cut key policy rates by a total of 75 basis points amid the sustained easing in domestic inflation. furthermore, the bsp reduced the universal and commercial banks’ reserve requirement ratio by a total of 400 basis points to help improve domestic liquidity and also support economic growth.
concerns over a slowing global economy, us fed policy decisions, and the us-china trade war were the main factors that influenced the global financial market. the philippine peso, however, remained relatively stable and even appreciated by 4% as of end-2019 amid peso-positive factors like benign inflation, robust international reserves, and solid remittance inflows.
heightened trade tensions negatively impacted the global economy through most of 2019 as the tit-for-tat trade dispute dampened economic activity and eroded business confidence in most of the world’s economies. for 2020, the global economy is seen to stage a rebound as trade and investment gradually recover. nevertheless, downside risks like geopolitical tensions and financial market volatility remain.
the outlook for the philippine economy, meanwhile, remains bullish amid expectations of still solid household spending, accelerated government spending, and recovery in investment spending. the timely approval of the 2020 national budget gives the government enough spending power to fast-track infra projects and guarantees the faster growth of construction activities in the different regions of the country. solid domestic demand will help shield the philippine economy from negative external developments.

to ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. based on this system of monitoring, the bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. as of december 31, 2019, the contractual maturity profile shows that the bank has at its disposal about p984.43 billion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. this will cover 66.89% of the p1.47 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. these cash inflows exclude securities booked in fvtpl and fvoci whose maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 82.0% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. on the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

in the normal course of the group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. no material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.

for the year 2020, the bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about p3.0 to p5.0 billion, of which 50% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.
