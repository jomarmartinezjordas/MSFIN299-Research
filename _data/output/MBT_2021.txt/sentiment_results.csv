2021 saw the global economy rebound from the 2020 slump as countries started to re-open and mobility restrictions were eased. the philippines, along with most of the world’s economies, was on a sustained climb out of the recession. second quarter growth posted the sharpest increase in a year, mostly on base effects. the positive expansion continued well into the last quarter, wherein growth was reported to be one of the highest in asia. compared to 2020, the economy has adapted and adjusted in terms of dealing and living with the surge and lockdown cycle.
full-year average inflation came in higher at 4.5% compared to 2.6% in 2020 amid the faster annual increases in some commodity groups, especially food, transportation, and oil. the price of food, a heavily-weighted commodity, was persistently higher through most the year as weather-related disturbances and the african swine fever outbreak adversely affected domestic supply conditions. furthermore, global commodity prices surged mid-2020 amid supply chain disruptions alongside increased global demand.
movement of domestic interest rates were mixed on factors such as ample liquidity condition, inflation fears, and expectations of higher interest rates. short-term rates were pinned within the 1% levels as the bangko sentral ng pilipinas kept policy rates steady throughout 2021. meanwhile, tenors above 1 year inched up towards their 2019 levels amid more issuances of longer-dated debt securities, rising global bond yields, and still elevated inflation.
surging inflation and expectations of a more hawkish federal reserve are the factors that supported the us dollar versus its peers. us consumer prices rose at the highest rate since 1990, while money markets are said to be pricing in a high probability of fed rate hikes in 2022. the philippine peso generally stayed within the p50:$1 level in the second half of last year amid tapering signals from the fed, higher global crude oil prices, and the gradual reopening of the domestic economy. as of the last day of 2021, the domestic currency depreciated by 6% from the start of the year close.
currently, the near-term outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain as a resurgence in covid infections, amid the highly contagious omicron variant, is likely to disrupt economic activity. furthermore, global growth could see a slowdown this year as more economies start exiting unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary policy support.
for the philippine economy, while rebound back to pre-pandemic nominal gdp levels is likely to happen this year, the economy is not expected to reach full capacity just yet given the lingering risks. the threat posed by omicron and other emerging virus variants continues to loom over our heads, especially as potential super spreader events like the campaign period and national elections could exacerbate our current covid situation.
