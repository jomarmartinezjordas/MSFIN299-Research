the philippine economy is again in a growth trajectory, with our 2019 forecast for gdp growth at 6.4% from last year's 6.2%. despite the slowdown in 2018, the economy still retained its label as one of the fastest growing in the asian region, and we expect it to remain that way. apart from the country's strong macroeconomic fundamentals and inflation easing this year, factors that will push economic growth are improved domestic and external demand, bigger infrastructure spending, higher tourism arrivals, and solid policy reforms.
