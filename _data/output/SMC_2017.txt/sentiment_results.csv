"the group’s consolidated sales revenue for the year 2017 amounted to p826,086 million, 21% higher than 2016, on the back of robust, double-digit growth across its fuels and petrochemicals, infrastructure, and beer, liquor, and packaging businesses.
the higher cost of sales resulted from the increase in crude prices of petron corporation (petron), increase in sales volume of petron and san miguel brewery inc. (smb), higher excise tax of smb domestic operations, and the higher coal prices and energy fees of smc global power holdings corp. (smc global).
sustained sales growth, coupled with effective fixed cost management, brought consolidated operating income to p111,042 million, 11% higher than last year.
the increase in equity in net earnings in 2017 primarily represents the share of smc global on the net income of angat hydropower corporation (angat hydro) vs net loss in 2016 offset by the decrease in net income of northern cement corporation (ncc).
the gain on sale of investments and property and equipment in 2017 pertains to the sale of service stations by petron malaysia to the malaysian government. certain service stations of petron malaysia were closed to give way to the mass rail transit project of malaysia.
the decrease in other charges was primarily due to the recognition of lower foreign exchange loss on the translation of the united states (us) dollar denominated long-term debt of the parent company, petron, and smc global, and finance lease liabilities of smc global, partly offset by the lower gain on foreign exchange from foreign currency denominated cash and cash equivalents of the parent company.
income from continuing operations amounted to p54,814 million, 36% higher compared to 2016.
consolidated recurring net income, excluding the effect of forex translation and one-time gain from the sale of the telecommunications business last year, was up 11% to p54,654 million, compared to the previous year’s p49,350 million.
share of non-controlling interests in the group’s net income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 mainly due to the higher net income of petron and smb.
consolidated volume of smb reached almost 260 million cases, surpassing last year’s volume by 13%. strong volume growth was driven mainly by favorable economic conditions, along with effective marketing campaigns and integrated sales initiatives. consolidated revenues rose 17% to p113,255 million.
strong domestic operations, coupled with the contributions of international operations, pushed operating income up 15% to p31,161 million, while net income rose 17% to p20,711 million.
with favorable economic conditions, domestic beer volumes rose 15%, boosted by strong marketing campaigns and integrated sales initiatives. revenues grew 18% to p99,999 million, partly reflecting a price increase implemented on october 1, 2017, as a result of the increase in excise tax. this significant improvement in volumes partly made up for the impact of higher excise taxes and operating costs and resulted to a 14% improvement in operating income to p30,139 million.
red horse extra strong beer and san miguel pale pilsen remained the top selling brands, with san mig light, gold eagle beer, and san miguel flavored beer turning in strong contributions as well.
smb implemented new marketing campaigns and consumer and trade programs to sustain volume growth, strengthen brand equity, and increase consumption. new digital video campaigns featuring actress ina raymundo and rapper curtsmith, as well as the “mbc bagong taon, bagong milyon” crown collection promo, strengthened pale pilsen’s position. meanwhile, red horse’s “pambansang muziklaban” and “pasiklaban” events continued to enable the brand to assert its position as “the no. 1 beer”. san mig light also continued to push its “mahaba-habang inuman” campaign through a new television commercial dubbed “5 signs”, while san miguel flavoured beer utilized digital and social media advertising to boost penetration of the ‘millennial’ market.

san miguel brewing international limited’s (smbil) operating income in 2017 grew 18% to us$24 million. smbil continued to intensify efforts to sustain profit growth and accelerate the growth of san miguel brands, including red horse. san miguel brands grew 6% versus last year on the back of strong results from south and north china, thailand, vietnam and the exports markets. however, due to lower sales from some local brands in indonesia and north china, overall volume declined 2%. revenues ended at us$263 million, at par with last year.
smbil continues to implement volume expansion initiatives for san miguel brands by increasing trade coverage as well as pursuing cost reduction and efficiency improvements.

for the fourth consecutive year, ginebra san miguel inc. (gsmi) registered continued growth. sales volumes rose 10% to 27.7 million cases, on the back of effective campaigns and below-the-line promotions, which led to higher consumption of flagship brand ginebra san miguel and vino kulafu. both brands posted double digit growth. consumers’ strong affinity to the barangay ginebra gin kings basketball team was a key contributor to growth, as was vino kulafu’s 60th year anniversary, which was hyped all-year-round via radio commercials anchored on its “dosenang lakas” proposition.
expansion of consumer market reach, particularly the millennial generation, also contributed to strong volumes. based on the nielsen retail audit as of december 2017, market share is now at 32%.

the poultry & meats and feeds businesses ended 2017 with revenues reaching p80,803 million, up 6% from 2016. this mainly was the result of better sales mix, favorable selling prices of chicken and fresh meats products and aggressive marketing and promotion activities for feeds.

smc global’s consolidated revenues for year 2017 grew 6% to p82,791 million, the result of higher realization prices from both bilateral and spot sales. consolidated off-take volume however ended slightly lower at 17,227 gigawatt hours (gwh) due to lower bilateral volumes from ilijan and san roque power plants. ilijan power plant’s block 1 underwent an annual maintenance shutdown as did the malampaya gas facility, from january 28 to february 16. block 2 experienced a temporary shutdown due to series of earthquakes that hit batangas at the beginning of the year. sual power plant’s unit 2 likewise experienced a shutdown from june 14 to november 10, due to a main generator transformer failure. san roque power plant also recorded lower power dispatch due to lower water level.

petron’s domestic performance was driven by higher sales of high-margin products such as gasoline, jet a-1, and lubricants. earlier in the year, petron launched the first and only euro 6 fuel, blaze 100 euro 6, considered the best gasoline in the country. sales of lubricants such as blaze racing also contributed to overall growth. these new products, together with better efficiencies and higher production capability at the upgraded petron bataan refinery, all helped boost philippine operations for the year.
