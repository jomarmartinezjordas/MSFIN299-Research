"the group performed very well in 2021, with some of
and even registered improvements over pre-pandemic 2019 performance. the group’s consolidated sales rose 30% to p941,193 million from p725,797 million in the previous year, with the food and beverage, energy, fuel and oil and infrastructure businesses all delivering double-digit revenue growth. this is still 8% behind 2019 pre-pandemic level but is nevertheless a big improvement coming from the 29% decline in 2020.
the group's cost of sales increased by p169,601 million or 29% mainly due to: a) higher cost per liter of fuel products and increase in sales volume of petron corporation (petron); b) higher cost of coal, full year operations of unit 3 of the masinloc power plant, which started commercial operations on september 26, 2020 and higher power purchases from the spot market and external suppliers of the energy business; and c) increase in sales volume and higher excise tax of the food and beverage business.
as a result of group-wide cost management efforts and the adoption of enhanced operational efficiencies, consolidated operating income grew 64% to p117,152 million from the previous year. this surpassed the group’s 2019 pre-pandemic operating income of p115,715 million by 1%.
the decrease in interest expense and other financing charges was mainly due to lower average interest rates and borrowing level of smc, petron and the food and beverage business, partly offset by the higher interest from higher loan balance of the infrastructure business.

the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates and average balance of cash and cash equivalents.
the increase in equity in net earnings of associates and joint ventures was mainly due to the share in the higher net income of bank of commerce (boc) and manila north harbour port, inc. (mnhpi) and share in the lower net loss of angat hydro corporation (angat hydro).
the gain on sale of property and equipment in 2021 mainly represents the gain on the disposal of properties by san miguel baoding brewery and san miguel china investment co. ltd. the loss in 2020 mainly represents the retirement by san miguel yamamura packaging corporation (smypc) of the fixed assets of its manila plastics plant which were damaged by the fire incident in pandacan, manila in february 2020.
other charges - net in 2021 primarily consist of the commodity hedging loss of petron and the loss on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated net liabilities of the group as a result of the depreciation of philippine peso against the us dollar by p2.98 in december 2021, partly offset by san miguel energy corporation’s (smec) recognition of income from the reduction of power sector assets and liabilities management corporation (psalm) fixed fee charges for the extended outages of sual power plant’s units 1 and 2. other income - net in 2020 pertains mainly to the: (a) gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated net liabilities of the group as a result of the appreciation of philippine peso against the us dollar by p2.61 in december 2020, (b) settlement received by the energy business from third party contractors on account of damages arising from the latter’s nonfulfillment of obligations under procurement- related contracts, and (c) income recognized by the group from the tax credit certificates (tcc) issued by the bureau of internal revenue (bir) in relation to the claims for refund filed for overpayment of excise taxes with the bir for san mig light.
the increase in income tax expense in 2021 was primarily due to the turnaround of petron resulting to an income tax expense in 2021 compared to income tax benefit in 2020. this was partly offset by the impact of the adoption of the corporate recovery and tax incentives for enterprises (create) law in 2021 and 2020, which reduced the income tax rate from 30% to 25%. the effect of the adoption of create law in 2020 was adjusted in the first quarter of 2021.
consolidated net income reached p48,159 million, up 120% from the p21,879 million reported in 2020. more significantly, this is almost at par with pre-pandemic net income level.
the share of non-controlling interests (nci) on the group's net income increased in 2021 mainly due to the: (a) net income of petron in 2021 compared to a net loss in 2020, (b) higher amount of distribution on senior perpetual capital securities (spcs) of smc global power holdings corp. (smc global) and petron and (c) higher net income of the food and beverage business.

san miguel food and beverage, inc. (smfb) delivered sustained growth throughout 2021, posting consolidated revenues of p309,778 million, an increase of 11% from last year, as the food, beer and non-alcoholic beverages (nab) and spirits divisions all turned in solid results.
smfb’s consolidated operating income improved 31% to p43,695 million while net income rose 40% to p31,417 million, a significant achievement considering the implementation of community lockdowns and liquor bans in many areas throughout the year, coupled with increasing raw material prices.

san miguel brewery inc. (smb) continued its recovery in 2021, as consolidated volumes slightly improved to 204.4 million cases. smb conducted programs to spur consumption to mitigate pandemic restrictions implemented in various parts of the country. consolidated sales amounted to p116,286 million, 8% higher compared to last year.
consolidated operating income grew 10% to p26,915 million on account of continuing cost management initiatives. net income rose 17% to p20,449 million.

smb’s domestic beer volumes moderately increased in 2021 while non-alcoholic beverage volumes ended significantly higher than last year. this represents a gradual recovery, coming from the large decline experienced in 2020. beer volumes improved through various thematic campaigns, activations and consumer promos, which boosted demand and consumption, and softened the effects of liquor bans and mobility restrictions. domestic beer sales amounted to p105,114 million, up 7% from the previous year, brought about by the full year impact of the price increase implemented in march 2020 and october 2021. operating income amounted to p25,224 million, an 8% increase over the previous year.
recovery was further reinforced by nationwide marketing programs and thematic campaigns. san miguel pale pilsen’s “beer call muna tayo” and san mig light’s “imagine” campaigns boosted brand equity while at the same time promoting home consumption and pushing for “e-numan” online gatherings. while red horse’s “patak” and “lakas” advertisements reinforced the brand’s leadership and value-for-money proposition. domestic operations also sustained visibility for gold eagle beer, through distinctive out-of-home installations and improved penetration in visayas region.

smb’s international operations likewise sustained its growth in 2021, posting an 8% and 11% volume and revenue improvement versus the previous year, respectively. this was primarily driven by volume expansion in indonesia and exports, offsetting shortfalls in south china, vietnam, hong kong and thailand which experienced extended and varied pandemic restrictions. with cost management programs and improved sales and operational efficiencies, operating income similarly grew compared to 2020.

ginebra san miguel inc. (gsmi) capped off another stellar year with volumes reaching an all-time high of 41.9 million cases, an 8% increase from 2020, and 17% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
growth was mainly the result of its successful marketing campaigns, namely: “bagong tapang” for gsm, “kusog kulafu” under-the-cap consumer promo in the visayas and mindanao regions for vino kulafu, and the “choose what’s true” campaign for gsm blue. these were further supported by national and local consumer promos, aggressive market penetration activities for push brands and continued expansion of distribution channels throughout the year.
revenues reached p42,534 million, 17% higher from the p36,202 million reported in 2020. operating income grew 39% to p5,293 million while net income amounted to p4,179 million, 52% higher than 2020 and 150% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic earnings.

the food division posted consolidated revenues of p150,970 million in 2021, 12% higher compared to the previous year and 8% higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.
growth was driven by the robust performance of the protein, animal nutrition and health, value-added meats and flour segments, all of which grew double-digits, boosted by favorable pricing and volume gains.
these brought the food division’s consolidated operating income to p11,506 million, a sizeable 122% increase from 2020, in spite of rising costs of major raw materials which put some pressure on margins. this was partly mitigated by the group-wide cost containment efforts, efficiency improvement initiatives, and the optimized utilization of company-wide production facilities.
as a result, consolidated net income surged to p7,610 million, a 165% increase from 2020 and 121% higher than the 2019 pre-pandemic earnings.

the protein segment, consisting of the magnolia chicken and monterey meats businesses, revenues grew 14% buoyed by improvements in chicken prices as the food division was able to keep its inventory at optimal level, even as industry supply was augmented by imported frozen chicken. the protein segment's performance received a boost from the growing network of community sellers, and the gradual recovery of lechon manok outlets.
the animal nutrition and health segment expanded revenues by 12% owing to sustained volume increases of free-range fowl, layer, duck, and aquatic feeds. this was brought about by the successful conversion campaigns, intensive penetration and sales activities targeting backyard and medium scale farms. meanwhile, as hog farms started to slowly repopulate with the waning of african swine fever (asf), sales of hog feeds showed slight recovery in the last quarter of 2021. likewise, demand for broiler feeds picked up with improved availability of day-old chicks.
prepared and packaged food segment’s consolidated revenues grew 6% from 2020, mainly driven by growth of value-added meats, led by core, flagship products purefoods tender juicy hotdog, chicken nuggets, and bacon. newly launched ready- to-eat products such as meat-free product line veega, purefoods spaghetti sauce and seafood nuggets also delivered remarkable growth in 2021.
meanwhile, magnolia’s revenues was lower than previous year as home-baking activities receded, while foodservice recovery remained limited. nonetheless, margarine, cheese, and san mig coffee sugar free variant grew steadily while sales of newly launched retail packs of magnolia salad aids have been promising.
the flour segment maintained its upward momentum with revenues ending 17% higher versus 2020. growth in all geographical areas, led by mindanao and the greater manila area was driven by strong volumes due to an expanded distribution network and the recovery in existing customers' operations.

the packaging business registered sales of p33,703 million in 2021, a 7% increase from the previous year, mainly driven by increase in volumes from food and beverage accounts, improved performance from the glass, plastics, metal crowns, and two-piece aluminum cans, and flexibles businesses, as well as better results from the australasian and malaysian operations.

operating income amounted to p1,162 million, 21% higher compared to 2020, on account of higher sales, effective cash management and maximization of cost containment measures.

smc global delivered off-take volumes of 27,221 gigawatt hours (gwh) in 2021, a 4% growth versus 2020, as industrial activities started to pickup with relatively lighter corona virus disease (covid)-19 quarantine restrictions compared to 2020. correspondingly with higher spot and average bilateral rates, consolidated revenues for the year rose by 16% to p133,710 million.
operating income declined by 14% to p31,886 million on account of a significant rise in average coal input costs and higher power purchases. the higher power purchases were the result of lack of peak capacity to serve the energy group’s improved bilateral requirements, with the continued deration of the ilijan power plant due to gas supply restriction and the extended outages in sual power plant.
consequently, net income amounted to p15,978 million, down by 15% from the previous year. without the recorded liquidated damages from a third-party contractor arising from non-fulfillment of obligations under its procurement-related contracts in 2020, net income would have been higher by around 5%.

petron continued to bounce back from the pandemic, delivering a net income of p6,136 million, reversing the p11,413 million net loss in 2020.
petron’s consolidated sales volume grew 5% to 82.2 million barrels, made possible by the easing of pandemic restrictions and the re-start of economic activities that improved overall demand.
petron philippines’ retail volumes increased by 6% brought about by volume-generating programs amid the implementation of granular lockdowns. industrial sales grew by 2% as travel restrictions eased out and more industries reopened. petron’s lubricant sales likewise grew which recorded the highest growth at 11%, highlighting the strong performance and presence of its locally produced engine oils and other lubricant products in the market.
consolidated sales for the year reached p438,057 million, up 53% from the previous year, driven by the increase in international prices and higher local demand. recovering oil demand and tightened supply caused dubai crude oil prices to breach the us$80 per barrel level in the fourth quarter which averaged nearly us$70 per barrel in 2021, 64% higher than 2020’s us$42 per barrel, the highest annual average price in the past three years.
with improved refining margins and various operational efficiencies continuously enacted, operating income grew 472% to p17,215 million, an immense turnaround from the p4,629 million operating loss reported in 2020.

the infrastructure business sales rose 35% to p19,690 million, mainly driven by a 35% combined increase in average daily traffic volume in all operating toll roads namely, south luzon expressway (slex), skyway stages 1, 2 and 3, southern tagalog arterial road (star) tollway, tarlac-pangasinan-la union expressway (tplex) and ninoy aquino international airport expressway, all posted double digit growth, indicating that more motorists are enjoying improving travel movement.

operating income grew by 164% to p6,788 million, mainly driven by volume increase and margin improvements backed by cost management initiatives.
