ayala corporation recorded a net income of ₱30.3 billion in 2017, climbing 16 percent from the previous year on the back of robust double-digit growth of its real estate and power businesses.

sales of goods and services climbed 22 percent to ₱242.2 billion, on the back of higher sales in all housing, residential, and condominium units of ayala land; strong vehicle sales across ac industrials‘ automotive brands; and the improved output of integrated micro-electronics‘ automotive electronics and industrial segments, as well as the consolidation of its new subsidiary. in addition, higher service revenues from ac energy, primarily from the consolidation of its new subsidiary and retail electricity supply (res) unit, as well as from imi and manila water, contributed to this. the account stands at 91 percent of ayala’s total revenues for 2017.

the resurgence of property sales combined with a solid leasing business drove ayala land’s net earnings during the year, jumping 21 percent to ₱25.3 billion.
revenues from property development, which includes residential and office-for-sale developments, as well as commercial lot sales, rose 23 percent to ₱101.5 billion on new bookings and project completion. growth in reservation sales bounced back to double-digit levels during the year at 13 percent, reaching ₱122 billion.
commercial leasing revenues, meanwhile, grew 10 percent to ₱31 billion driven by new mall openings, stabilized occupancy of office spaces, and the improved performance of its hotels and resorts portfolio.
ayala land’s strategy to rebalance its net income mix is increasingly taking shape. in terms of location, established estates (makati, nuvali, bonifacio global city, alabang and cebu) accounted for 54 percent, while new estates and growth centers made up for 46 percent of ayala land’s net earnings in 2017. in terms of business line, ayala land’s recurring income (mall and office leasing, hotels and resorts, and property management segments) accounted for 35 percent, while development income (property sales and construction) contributed 65 percent of ayala land’s net income during the year.

manila water posted a muted net income growth of one percent to ₱6.2 billion as higher operating expenses and business development costs tempered topline growth during the year.
revenues rose five percent to ₱18.5 billion, bolstered by strong revenue contributions from laguna water and boracay water, as well as higher supervision fees recognized by estate water balancing out flat revenue growth in the manila concession.
operating expenses expanded 19 percent to ₱7.4 billion on higher overhead costs owing to estate water’s expansion, business development costs, and a one-time write-off of uncollectible accounts in laguna water.
manila water posted higher billed volume across all its business lines, with the non-manila concession posting strong double-digit billed volume growth. this brought total billed volume to 738.7 million cubic meters, three percent higher year-on-year. in the manila concession, the two percent-increase in billed volume helped offset the impact of tariff reduction.
manila water continues to intensify its infrastructure build-up with a 48 percent expansion in capital expenditures. last year, the manila concession completed the marikina north sewerage treatment plant, while the pasig north and south system project is scheduled for completion in november 2019. both projects have a capacity of 100 million liters per day.
further, manila water received a notice of award from the city of ilagan water district to establish a joint venture for a bulk water supply and septage management company. manila water also received a notice of award from the leyte metropolitan water district to establish a joint venture for a concession company. as part of its ongoing expansion in southeast asia, manila water is establishing a footprint in thailand with the signing of a share purchase agreement in february to acquire an 18.72 percent stake in eastern water resources development and management public company limited, a publicly- listed water supply and distribution company in thailand.

ac industrials registered a net income of ₱1.2 billion, up four percent from its year-ago level, on the better performance of both its electronics manufacturing and vehicle retail units.
imi’s net earnings expanded 21 percent to us$34 million on the back of solid revenue growth, which exceeded the us$1 billion mark during the year. this topline growth was driven by contribution from recent acquisitions and sustained growth in the automotive and industrial markets.
last february, imi successfully completed its ₱4.998 billion rights offer with the issue of 350 million common shares to existing shareholders. ac industrials, which previously held 50.6 percent of imi’s outstanding shares, subscribed to its proportionate share, as well as any unsubscribed rights shares. this raised its stake in imi to 52 percent. proceeds of the rights offer will be used to fund imi’s capital expenditure program and for debt refinancing.
meanwhile, revenues from ac automotive expanded 37 percent to ₱31.2 billion, boosted by strong sales across all brands—honda, isuzu, volkswagen, and ktm.
ac industrials continues to ramp up its portfolio in global and domestic industrial technologies by capitalizing on opportunities arising from disruptive technological shifts, changing industry landscapes, and increasing demand from end-users. last month, ac industrials acquired a controlling stake in merlin solar technologies inc., with an ownership interest of 78.2 percent after the close of the transaction and completion of other related activities. merlin is an emerging company that is developing differentiated solar solutions resulting in products with high durability, flexibility, and increased solar power output, allowing for potentially innovative applications in areas with demanding environments, such as transportation and infrastructure. headquartered in san jose, california, merlin currently has additional manufacturing facilities in thailand.

ac energy’s net earnings jumped 31 percent to ₱3.5 billion in 2017, primarily driven by fresh equity earnings contribution from its geothermal platform, and boosted by solid contributions from its wind energy assets.
a strong wind regime bolstered the better performance of northwind and north luzon renewables during the year. services income derived from the financial close of a new power plant likewise contributed to ac energy’s net earnings.
ac energy continues to execute on its diversification strategy. following the acquisition of salak and darajat geothermal in indonesia in early 2017, ac energy is assembling a portfolio of renewable energy assets in southeast asia. it is developing a 75 megawatt wind project in sidrap, indonesia, which is expected to come online in the first quarter of 2018.
last january, ac energy, in partnership with bim group of vietnam, agreed to jointly develop over 300 megawatts of solar power projects in ninh thuan province, vietnam. the initial 30 megawatts of the solar project broke ground, with investment for this phase expected to reach 800 billion vnd and to be completed within the year. the solar project is envisioned to be expanded by an additional 300 megawatts.
similarly, ac energy is boosting its conventional energy portfolio. last december, the project financing for the second unit of its 2 x 668 mw super-critical coal fired power plant in bataan, gnpower dinginin, achieved financial close. ac energy has approximately 50 percent economic stake in the project, which has an estimated cost of us$1.7 billion. the project will support the increasing electricity demand of luzon and visayas. construction of the first unit is well underway, and is targeted for commercial operations by 2019, with the second unit scheduled for completion by 2020.

share of profits of associates and joint ventures reached ₱18.5 billion, up two percent, primarily on the steady increase of equity earnings from investees of ayala land and ac energy, and the better performance of bpi. this was partially offset by a slight decline in share in earnings from globe.

bank of the philippine islands recorded a net income of ₱22.4 billion, up 1.7 percent from its year-ago level, as the absence of one-off gains tempered strong growth in its core banking business during the year. excluding one-off gains from the sale of securities in 2016, net income grew 31 percent in 2017.
total revenues rose seven percent to ₱71 billion as net interest income expanded 13 percent to ₱48 billion driven by asset growth and improvement in net interest margin. non-interest income, meanwhile, dropped five percent to ₱22.9 billion on the absence of significant trading gains registered in 2016. this was partially offset by the bank’s higher fee-based income, which grew 16 percent to ₱19.9 billion, lifted by higher credit card fees, trust and investment management fees, insurance fees, bank commissions, and service charges.
bpi continues to be a leader in profitability metrics, with cost-to-income ratio at 54.3 percent, slightly higher from the 52.5 percent posted a year ago, mainly driven by its digitalization initiatives.
total loans jumped 16 percent to ₱1.2 trillion, boosted by corporate loans. asset quality improved with the gross 90-day non-performing loans ratio declining from 1.46 percent to 1.29 percent and reserve cover ratio increasing from 119 percent to 129 percent.
last year, bpi announced the creation of a business banking segment, a new client group focused on the banking needs of the country’s small and medium scale enterprises. it also raised a record ₱12.2 billion from its offering of long-term negotiable certificates of time deposit, the largest issuance by far in the industry.
last january, the bank announced a stock rights offering of up to ₱50 billion to support its strategic initiatives, including the strengthening of its market-leading businesses and core franchises through the expansion of lending activities across consumer, sme, and microfinance segments to capture positive momentum in the domestic economy. in addition, the stock rights offer will strengthen bpi’s capital base as it pursues its growth strategy in the medium term. ayala has signified its participation in the rights offering.

globe telecom’s net earnings dropped five percent to ₱15.1 billion in 2017 due to higher operating expenses and depreciation charges as a result of increased investments in its data network.
topline growth, however, remains strong, with service revenues reaching ₱127.9 billion during the year, up six percent year-on-year. this was fueled by sustained demand for data-related products. mobile revenues grew seven percent to ₱98.5 billion. globe’s mobile subscriber base reached 60.7 million at the end of 2017, three percent lower from a year ago. the decline in the cumulative mobile subscriber base was a result of the change in reporting globe’s prepaid subscribers in 2017, which excluded prepaid subscribers who do not reload within 90 days of the second expiry period. mobile data continues to drive globe’s total mobile revenues, accounting for 44 percent from 38 percent a year ago.
globe’s home broadband segment posted a seven percent increase in revenues to ₱15.6 billion in 2017. total home broadband subscribers climbed 15 percent to 1.3 million year-on-year, putting globe on track with its target to provide internet service to two million homes by 2020. corporate data business increased four percent from a year ago to ₱10.3 billion owing to strong demand for data-driven solutions by corporates.
globe’s consolidated ebitda improved seven percent to ₱53.3 billion, while ebitda margin stood at 42 percent from 41 percent in the previous year.

globe spent around ₱42.5 billion in capital expenditure in 2017 to support its continuous network infrastructure enhancement. it launched new products to enable the filipino digital lifestyle, including mynt’s rollout of the gcash scan-to-pay system in malls, fast food chains, major retailers, and convenience stores.

other income surged 66 percent to ₱20.9 billion in 2017, as compared to ₱12.6 billion in the previous year. this was largely attributed to income from higher rehabilitation works of manila water; the reversal of impairment provision for a real estate property and higher management and marketing fees of ayala land; commission fees of ac energy; and gains on disposal of certain investments of ag holdings. other charges which pertain to rehabilitation works consequently increased in 2017.


consolidated cost of sales for the year stood at ₱175.7 billion, a 24 percent increase, brought about by higher sales from the real estate segment, particularly in lots and residential units, ac industrials‘ electronic manufacturing and automotive retail businesses, and stronger service revenues of the energy group.
consolidated general and administrative expenses rose 20 percent to ₱25.2 billion. this was a result of combined increments in the groups expenses, particularly from ayala land’s contracted services, professional fees, taxes, retirement, and trainings; the parent’s, ac energy’s, and manila water’s manpower, insurance costs, depreciation expenses, as well as manila water’s ar provisions; ac industrials‘ automotive business‘ marketing and promotional expenses, and imi’s manpower costs and professional and management fees. this also includes the impact of consolidation of imi and ac energy’s new subsidiaries.

ayala’s balance sheet remains at a healthy level, allowing it to continue supporting its investments and meet its debt and dividend obligations.
investments in associates and joint ventures rose to ₱202.6 billion, as a result of new investments made by ac energy, ac ventures, and ayala land. the parent’s share in net earnings from bpi and globe, as well as existing investees of ayala land, manila water, ac energy, and ac infrastructure, also contributed to growth, tempered in part by bestfull’s disposal of certain investments.
investments in property jumped 24 percent to ₱137.7 billion through the real estate unit’s expansion projects in malls, office properties, and select land development. meanwhile, investments in property and equipment recorded a 33 percent increase to ₱85.4 billion. this was lifted by ac energy’s construction of power plants for gnp kauswagan, ayala land’s capex for hotels and resorts, imi’s new capital spending for its europe and mexico sites, and manila water’s expansion projects. the impact from the consolidation of ac energy’s and imi’s new subsidiaries also factored in this account’s growth.
at the end of 2017, total debt at the consolidated level stood at ₱350.6 billion, a 19 percent increase from the december 2016 level of ₱295.9 billion. this was due to capital-raising exercises by the parent, ayc, and ayala land, as well as borrowings for expansion projects of the real estate, energy, and water segments. total assets crossed the ₱1 trillion mark in 2017.
cash at the parent level reached ₱18.6 billion, while net debt stood at ₱64.7 billion. net debt-to-equity ratio was 0.68 at the consolidated level, and 0.59 at the parent level. ayala’s loan-to-value ratio, or the ratio of the parent net debt to the total value of its investments, was 6.4 percent as of end-december 2017.

the philippines continues to grow at a healthy pace. already-robust domestic consumption is expected to increase further, supported by the passage of the first package of the government’s tax reform program. some pockets of uncertainty remain, particularly in external and internal policy that may affect trade, and the local business and investment climate. as such, the group will continue to monitor relevant global and domestic macroeconomic indicators that may have an effect on its businesses.
ayala remains overall positive about the macroeconomic environment and its prospects for growth as it continues to execute on its five-year growth strategy through 2020.
