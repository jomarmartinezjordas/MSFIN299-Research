the challenges brought about by the covid-19 pandemic that started in march 2020, and still continuing as of report date, have had significant impact on global economy as pandemic restrictions weaken economic conditions in many markets. the group has conducted business operations in compliance with government directives and protocols. the group has diversified revenue streams, by product types and geographic locations, that help mitigate the impact of the pandemic-related restrictions. its growth trajectory has taken an upswing in 2021 as all business segments have recovered in 2021 as compared to 2020, with the loosening up of restrictions in spite of the covid-19 infection waves and varying lockdown sways.

the philippine economy grew 5.6% year-on-year (“yoy") in 2021, a turnaround from the 9.6% contraction in 2020, with yoy recovery recorded in second to fourth quarters of the year, in spite of the spiking covid cases in april and august when alpha beta and delta variants swept the country. restrictions loosened up towards mid-november to december, in time for the christmas season, as the entire philippines was put under alert level 2 in december, where operating capacity for business and activities were increased up to 50% indoor and 70% outdoor and age mobility restrictions more relaxed.
the group ended the year strongly with p23.8 billion net profit (“np”), out of which p16.9 billion was attributable to owners (“npo”), respectively rebounding 132% and 92% yoy, on the back of a 19% growth in revenues and income. this hefty performance was attributed to agi’s diversified portfolio and continuous drive for operating efficiencies. net profit rate (“npr”) was registered at 16% while net-profit-to-owners rate (“npor”) was at 11%, both surpassing 2020 rates of 8% and 7% and 2019 rates of 15% and 10%, respectively.
the group grew revenues and other income, net profit and net profit attributable to owners by 15%, 65% and 64% yoy, respectively, in the fourth quarter, ascribing respectively 10%, 41% and 40% upticks quarter-on-quarter (“qoq”).
megaworld, one of the country’s property giants, reported revenues and income of p50.8 billion, np of p14.4 billion and npo of p13.4 billion that exceeded last year’s results by 17% and 36%, respectively, due to less restrictive business activities. npr improved to 28% as compared to 24% a year ago and 29% two years ago.

revenues from the hotel business jumped 30% to p1.9 billion from p1.5 billion a year ago, with occupancy rate of 84%, due to increasing mobility of people and easement of gathering restriction. hotel revenues in last quarter soared 108% yoy and 18% qoq.

emperador, the world’s largest brandy company and owner of the world’s 5th largest producer of scotch whisky in the world by capacity (source: scotch whisky industry review, 2020), performed better in 2021 amidst a still volatile environment3, anchored on the strength of its diversified portfolio and international operations. np for the year surged 26% yoy to a record-high of p10.1 billion, as revenues and income jumped 6% yoy to p55.9 billion. npo accelerated to p10.0 billion, up 25% yoy. gross profit rate (“gpr”) improved to 36% from 31% a year ago, and npr and npor higher at 18% this year as compared to 15% a year ago. normalized net profit [i.e. p0.7 billion non-cash consolidation tax adjustment in 2021 added back] soared 35% to p10.8 billion, of which p 10.6 billion was attributable to owners, up 34% year-on-year.
the brandy segment realized np of p7.6 billion during the year, up 31% yoy, as it turned over p37.2 billion revenues and income from external customers, up 1% yoy. brandy sales grew yoy at both the philippine and international markets, particularly in mexico, spain and usa where restrictions on on- trade business have loosened up. ‘emperador’, ‘fundador’, ‘presidente’, and ‘terry’ remained as the top-selling brandy brands, with sales increases registered during the year. sales of ‘harveys bristol cream’ also rose as it sold well in uk. gross profit expanded 24% yoy to p12.6 billion with gpr improving to 34% from 28% of a year ago as more of high-margin products were sold in the current year. the higher gp and lower operating costs lifted both np and npo to p7.6 billion and p7.4 billion, respectively, with npr and npor of 20% in the current year as compared to 15% a year ago.
