share in net earnings in associates and joint ventures declined by 7% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to decreases in contributions from wmpc, sppc, rp energy, sfelapco, and large hydropower plants, sn aboitiz power-magat and sn aboitiz power-benguet. lower income contributions attributable to large hydropower plants were due to a lower hydrology in 2018 compared to the higher than usual hydrology levels during 2017.
consolidated ebitda increased by 8% in 2018, primarily due to the fresh contributions from pec and hedcor bukidnon, which commenced commercial operations in march 2018 and july 2018, respectively, and further augmented by higher contributions from gmcp due to higher availability factor in 2018 as compared to the previous year. these were largely offset by lower contributions arising from: (i) tsi due to higher operating costs; and (ii) tmo due to expiration of power supply contracts in 2018.
during 2018, cash and cash equivalents increased by ₱10.64 bn, due to higher operating cash flows, proceeds from debt-raising activities at parent, and proceeds of the long-term debts of gmcp and tvi. in 2018, the company also managed to return the same levels of cash dividends to its shareholders, and deploy financial resources to continue the construction of various greenfield projects.
current ratio at the end of 2018 was at 1.89x from the previous year’s 1.38x, due to the 31% increase in current assets and 5% decrease in current liabilities.
debt-to-equity ratio as of december 31, 2018 was at 1.85, lower than the 1.92 recorded at the end of 2017.

net income for 2018 increased 6% year-on-year (yoy), from ₱20.42 bn in 2017 to ₱21.71 bn in 2018. this translated to earnings per share of ₱2.95. during 2018, the company recognized non-recurring losses of ₱2.08 bn (versus 2017’s loss of ₱2.93 bn) mainly resulting from: (i) foreign exchange (forex) losses from revaluation of dollar-denominated liabilities; and (ii) asset impairment. adjusting for these one-off losses, the company’s core net income for 2018 amounted to ₱23.78 bn, up by 2% yoy.

the power generation group and res’ income contribution for 2018 was ₱19.96 bn, up 12% yoy. the growth was largely driven by fresh income contributions from pec and hedcor bukidnon. netting out forex losses and impairment costs recognized in 2018, the generation group and res’ core net income contribution remained flat at ₱20.95 bn. capacity sold during 2018 was flat yoy, from 3,167 mw in 2017 to 3,152 mw in 2018.
	

the power distribution group’s earnings contribution decreased by 5% yoy, from ₱4.27 bn in 2017 to ₱4.05 bn in 2018. stripping out the impairment loss in 2018, its recurring earnings contribution grew 6% yoy from ₱4.11 bn in 2017 to ₱4.37 bn in 2018. this increase was mainly attributable to electricity sales which increased by 5% yoy, from 5,288 gwh in 2017 to 5,540 gwh in 2018 as energy sales grew across all customer segments.

the 10% increase in operating revenues was mainly attributable to the higher revenues recorded by the power generation and res groups, which combined accounted for ₱10.59 bn of the ₱12.18 bn increase. the higher revenues were driven by: (i) fresh contributions from pec and hedcor bukidnon; and (ii) higher sales at tli. these were offset by lower revenues at some of the oil-fired power generation companies (oil group).
the increase in operating revenues was also attributable to higher electricity sales during 2018 by the company’s two largest distribution utilities. this segment of the company’s business experienced a ₱1.35 bn increase in operating revenues.

operating expenses increased by 12% during 2018, driven by the 25% increase in cost of generated power as fuel costs rose during the year. depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses also went up as power plants entered commercial operations during the year.

the decrease in interest income during 2018 was mainly due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances carried at the company and at two of its intermediate holding companies, ari and tpi, for most of the year.

interest expense increased in 2018 as the company issued a total of ₱10.20 bn in retail bonds in october 2018. pec also started to recognize interest on its project loans during 2018. these new interest charges were offset by the lower interest expense taken up at tpi as it fully paid its dollar-denominated loan in 2018.

share in net earnings of associates and joint ventures declined by 7% in 2018, as lower contracted capacities at two associate oil companies operating in mindanao, wmpc and sppc, led to lower contributions. sfelapco also saw a decline in net profits during the year. lastly, the effects of the el niño in 2018 led to lower water levels, which adversely affected income contributions from sn aboitizpower-magat and sn aboitizpower-benguet.

this account stayed in an expense position at year-end 2018 due to net unrealized forex loss in 2018, primarily due to the restatement of tli’s dollar-denominated debt on its monthly obligations to the psalm. the decrease in this expense line item was from other income recognized on supplier settlements recognized at pec.

the decrease was due to deferred tax benefits recognized in 2018 at davao light for the impairment of assets, and at tli on unrealized forex losses.

the increase in the contributions from gmcp during 2018 also led to the higher take-up of attributed income for gmcp minority shareholders.

the movements in cumulative translation adjustments led to the increase in total net other comprehensive income for 2018 at ₱1.06 bn (versus ₱378 mn in 2017). total consolidated comprehensive income was ₱26.49 bn for the year.

total assets (as of december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017) increased by ₱28.19 bn, or 8% yoy. the major movements of the accounts leading to the increase were as follows:
(a) cash and cash equivalents increased by 30% during 2018. cash generated from operations increased
supplemented by the lower cash used in financing activities due to loan proceeds. the consolidated cash
position of the company increased by ₱10.64 bn.
(b) trade and other receivables increased by 25% (from ₱17.36 bn in 2017 to ₱21.72 bn in 2018) mainly due to
advances to partners in gmcp and the take-up of the psalm deferred adjustments at davao light and veco. psalm deferred adjustment pertains to generation rate adjustment mechanism and incremental currency exchange rate adjustment to be recovered from customers or to be collected from psalm.
(c) net derivative assets went down by ₱161 mn during 2018 mainly due to mark-to-market losses on the group’s swap and forward contracts.
(d) inventories increased by 19% (from ₱5.64 bn in 2017 to ₱6.69 bn in 2018) as the group recognized inventories held at tpvi, which took over the naga power plant complex in 2018, and due to higher inventory balances at gmcp, tsi and tvi. this was offset by lower inventory balances at the oil group.
(e) property held for sale of ₱676 mn as of december 31, 2018 pertains to transmission assets that will be transferred and sold to the ngcp. this account was nil in 2017.
(f) other current assets was higher by 46% (from ₱9.03 bn in 2017 to ₱13.21 bn in 2018) mainly driven by the increase of restricted cash at tsi. the maintenance of a cash reserve forms part of tsi’s compliance with the covenants on its project debt. tvi’s recognition of a receivable from ngcp on the construction of transmission line also contributed to the increase in this account.
(g) investments and advances increased mainly as a result of capital infusions into gnpd as it continues the
construction of a 1x668 mw supercritical coal-fired power plant in bataan. the account increased from
₱31.25 bn at the end of 2017 to ₱34.33 bn at the end of 2018.
(h) property, plant and equipment (ppe) slightly increased by 2% (from ₱204.03 bn in 2017 to ₱207.11 bn in
2018) mainly due to new additions during 2018 for the on-going construction of hydropower facilities under
hedcor and hedcor bukidnon, and tvi’s coal plant.
(i) available-for-sale investments went from ₱103 mn in 2017 to nil at the end of 2018 as these were reclassified
to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
(j) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss went up to ₱101 mn in 2018 from nil as these were
reclassified from available-for-sale investments.
(k) net pension assets increased by ₱71 mn in 2018 due to the increase in the fair value of plan assets for
contributions made during 2018.
(l) deferred income tax assets increased by 59% (from ₱1.41 bn in 2017 to ₱2.23 bn in 2018). the increase was
driven by the deferred tax benefits recognized by davao light in 2018 on the impairment of its assets and at tli for unrealized forex losses.

consolidated liabilities increased by 7% yoy, from ₱237.50 bn at the end of 2017 to ₱253.09 bn at the end of 2018. the major movements of the accounts leading to the increase were as follows:
(a) short term loans were up 145%, or ₱6.83 bn, mainly due to new loans of the company for working capital purposes.
(b) trade and other payables increased by 10% (from ₱19.85 bn in 2017 to ₱21.80 bn in 2018), primarily due to the take-up of the psalm deferred adjustment at davao light and veco. psalm deferred adjustment refers to the amounts to be remitted to psalm or refunded to customers.
(c) income tax payable decreased by 32% (from ₱646 mn in 2017 to ₱439 mn in 2018) primarily due to lower corporate taxes payable at the end of 2018.
(d) long-term debt (current and non-current portions) increased by 4% (from ₱152.05 bn in 2017 to ₱158.06 bn in 2018). the increase was mainly attributable to the net effect of the following:
(i) the company’s ₱10.20 bn new bonds issued in october 2018;
(ii) net increase during 2018 of gmcp’s project debt by ₱10.67 bn, which was a combination of new
drawdowns and forex adjustment; and (iii) tpi’s loan payment of ₱15.15 bn.
(e) finance lease obligation (current and noncurrent portions) decreased by 5% from a total of ₱49.23 bn in 2017 to ₱46.89 bn at the end of 2018, as tli made timely payments on its obligation to psalm during 2018.
(f) long term obligation on power distribution system (pds) decreased by 7% as regular annual payments were made.
(g) asset retirement obligation increased by 24% (₱2.96 bn in 2017 to ₱3.68 bn in 2018) due to an increase in the estimated future decommissioning costs on the group’s steam field assets.
(h) deferred income tax liabilities (dtl) decreased by 6% ₱913 mn in 2017 to ₱858 mn in 2018), mainly due to unrealized gain on forward contract in 2017 that was reversed in 2018.
(i) net pension liabilities decreased by 32% (₱361 mn in 2017 to ₱245 mn in 2018) on account of benefits paid to retired employees during the year.
(j) other noncurrent liabilities went from ₱403 mn in 2017 to ₱3.18 bn at the end of 2018 due to the recognition of the psalm deferred adjustment.

equity attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company increased by 11% yoy (from ₱115.40 bn at the end of 2017 to ₱127.71 bn at the end of 2018), driven mainly by the recognition of income during 2018 of ₱21.71 bn, net of dividends declared and paid to the company’s shareholders.

cash generated from operations of ₱37.29 bn continued to provide a source of liquidity during 2018, growing by ₱7.05 bn as compared to 2017. cash from the operations of fully-commissioned pec augmented the cash streams from operations.
during 2018, the group utilized ₱7.24 bn cash for investing activities. this was ₱2.21 bn more than during 2017, the largest portion of which was used to construct a coal plant in the visayas for tvi. meanwhile, the company continued to deploy financial resources in the construction of other greenfield projects. funds were also invested to infuse more capital to gnpd. the outflows were supported by dividends received during 2018.
in 2018, the company availed of long-term debt through a bond issuance, fresh loans availed of by certain subsidiaries, and draw down on project finance facilities. in the first half of 2018, the company declared ₱10.23 bn in dividends to its shareholders. these activities led to cash flow used in financing activities of ₱19.16 bn during 2018.
as of december 31, 2018, the group’s cash and cash equivalents increased to ₱46.34 bn, compared to ₱35.70 bn as of the end of 2017.

current assets increased by 31% while current liabilities decrease by 5%, the current ratio at the end of 2018 was at 1.89x, versus 1.38x at the end of 2017.
consolidated debt to equity ratio at the end of 2018 was at 1.85 versus 1.92 as of end 2017, as the company’s increase in equity surpassed the increase in liabilities.

aboitizpower is focused on addressing the needs of its markets, namely: (1) reliable supply, at a (2) reasonable cost, and with (3) three minimal impact on the environment and communities. the company believes that no single technology that can completely address the country’s energy requirements and that a mix of power generation technologies is necessary to address the country’s needs. thus, aboitizpower continues to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies, where and when it makes sense.
despite increased competition in the power generation market, the company is confident that it has built the foundation to sustain long term growth, as seen in its pipeline of new projects (see part 1 (i) general of electricity on page 5 where target commercial operation dates for each project are discussed per business unit). the company is also currently on track with its target to reach 4,000 mw net attributable capacity by 2020.
aboitizpower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. its sound financial condition is expected to give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.
the company expects that its existing distribution utilities will continue to realize modest growth. it continuously seeks efficiency and improvements in its distribution utilities’ operations in order to maintain healthy margins.
aboitizpower has alloted over ₱50 bn for capital expenditures in 2019, about 80% of which is for thermal projects, and the remaining balance allocated mainly for exploratory and operating activities.
other known trends, events, uncertainties which may have material impact on the registrant have been discussed in previous sections of the report (e.g., for an extensive discussion on regulatory issues, see part 1 (xi) effects of existing or probable government regulations on the business on page 40).
