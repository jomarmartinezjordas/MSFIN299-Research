share in net earnings in associates and joint ventures declined by 12% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower income contributions from sn aboitiz power-magat, inc. (sn aboitiz power-magat) and gnpower dinginin ltd. co. (gnpd). the lower share in net earnings of gnpd was mainly due to a foreign exchange (forex) gain recorded in 2018 as against a forex loss reported in 2019. sn aboitiz power-magat’s lower income contribution was primarily driven by a reduction in volume sold due to reduced water levels in 2019.
consolidated ebitda decreased by 13% in 2019, mainly due to an increase in cost of purchased power, lower spot market revenues, and lower plant availability across the power generation group.
during 2019, cash and cash equivalents decreased by ₱8.91 bn, due to cash flows used for the acquisition of aa thermal, inc. (aa thermal) and investment in gnpd for the ongoing construction of its 1x668 mw supercritical coal- fired power plant in bataan.
current ratio at the end of 2019 was at 1.50x, down from previous year’s 1.89x. this is due to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents and the increase in currently maturing debt.
debt-to-equity ratio as of december 31, 2019 was at 2.07, higher than the 1.85 recorded at the end of 2018 due to the availment of new debts during 2019.

net income for 2019 decreased 20% year-on-year (yoy), from ₱21.71 bn in 2018 to ₱17.32 bn in 2019, which translated to earnings per share of 2.35. in 2019, there was higher cost of purchased power, lower spot market revenues, and lower plant availability of the power generation group. the company also recognized non-recurring gains of ₱702 mn, mainly due to net foreign exchange gains from the revaluation of dollar-denominated debts and derivatives, aseagas, inc.’s vat recoveries, and gain on land appraisal. without these one-off gains, the company’s core net income for 2019 was ₱16.62 bn, 30% lower than the ₱23.8 bn recorded during 2018.

the power generation group and res’ income contribution for 2019 was ₱15.28 bn, down 23% yoy. the decline was largely driven by the higher volume and cost of purchased power, lower spot market revenues, and lower plant availability. spot market prices were high in the first half of 2019. during this period, the group purchased replacement power due to outages, and contracted ahead in preparation for therma visayas, inc.’s (tvi) incoming capacity. plant availability was also lower versus the same period last year due to outages from the group’s local facilities.

as of year-end 2019, aboitizpower’s net sellable capacity stood at 3,455 mw.

the power distribution group’s earnings contribution increased slightly by 1% yoy, from ₱4.05 bn in 2018 to ₱4.10 bn in 2019.

the 5% decrease in operating revenues was driven by: (i) lower plant availability, (ii) expiration of contracts with customers of therma marine, inc. (tmi) and thermal mobile, inc. (tmo), and (iii) lower average selling price on the power generation group and res power supply contracts. this was partly offset by higher electricity sales from the company’s distribution utilities.
the lower plant availability due to outages resulted to a reduction in the volume (capacity and energy) sold to customers. likewise, this limited the group’s capacity available to sell to the spot market.

operating expenses increased by 2% during 2019, driven by the increase in depreciation and amortization cost (14%) due to the start of operations of tvi and the full year of operations for both hedcor bukidnon, inc. (hedcor bukidnon) and pagbilao energy corporation (pec). the cost or purchased power and operations and maintenance expenses also increased during the year.

the increase in interest income during 2019 was primarily due to the company’s higher cash investments and higher interest income from therma south, inc. (tsi), tvi, hedcor bukidnon and ap renewables, inc. (apri).

interest expense increased in 2019 due to the full-year impact of the ₱10.20 bn in retail bonds issued by the company in october 2018 and the interest on the company’s ₱7.25 bn retail bonds issued in october 2019. the proceeds from the bonds were used to pay for short-term borrowings and general corporate purpose.

share in net earnings of associates and joint ventures declined by 12% in 2019, mainly due to lower income contributions from sn aboitiz power-magat and gnpd. sn aboitiz power-magat’s lower income contribution was primarily driven by a reduction in volume sold due to reduced water levels in 2019. the lower share in net earnings of gnpd was mainly due to a forex gain recorded in 2018 as against a forex loss reported in 2019.

the change from an expense position in 2018 to an income position in 2019 was mainly due to lower net forex losses yoy. this movement was due to favorable movements of the philippine peso against u.s. dollar in 2019 versus 2018.

the increase was due to lower net deferred tax benefit arising from deferred taxes on unrealized forex gain.

the decrease was due to a decline in the operating results of gmcp combined with a reduction in the company’s non- controlling ownership in gmcp after the acquisition of non-controlling interests in may 2019.

total assets (as of december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018) increased by ₱20.81 bn, or 5% yoy. the major movements of the accounts leading to the increase were as follows:
a) cash and cash equivalents decreased by 19% during 2019. this was due to cash flows used for: (i) acquisition of aa thermal, (ii) investment in gnpd for its on-going power plant construction, (iii) funding of the group’s capital expenditures, and (iv) debt service. the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by operating cash flows and proceeds from the company’s retail bonds issuance in 2019.
b) property held for sale of ₱676 mn as of december 31, 2018 pertains to transmission assets was sold to ngcp in february 2019.
c) other current assets were lower by 16% (from ₱13.21 bn in 2018 to ₱11.04 bn in 2019) mainly driven by the decrease of tsi’s restricted cash. the maintenance of a cash reserve forms part of tsi’s compliance with the covenants on its project debt.
d) investments and advances increased by ₱26.54 mainly as a result of capital infusions for the aa thermal acquisition and gnpd plant construction.
e) property, plant and equipment (ppe) slightly increased by 1% (from ₱207.11 bn in 2018 to ₱209 bn in 2019) mainly due to the recognition of right-of-use assets on the group’s leases resulting from the adoption of philippine financial reporting standards (pfrs) 16, leases.
f) derivatives assets were down by ₱211 mn in 2019, primarily due to fair value changes on gmcp’s interest rate swaps.
g) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss went down to ₱4 mn in 2019 from ₱101 mn. this was mainly due to the sale of parent’ company’s financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (fvpl).
h) deferred income tax assets increased by 25% (from ₱2.23 bn in 2018 to ₱2.80 bn in 2019), driven by deferred tax benefits recognized by tmo on its net operating loss and therma luzon, inc. (tli) on its unrealized forex loss.
i) other noncurrent assets increased by ₱2.86 bn or 27% yoy. the increase was due to restricted cash of a subsidiary that arose from its receipt of proceeds from a damage claim against its contractors, which claim is currently under dispute. this was partly offset by decrease in input vat and reversal of prepaid rent against lease liabilities upon adoption of pfrs 6, leases.

consolidated liabilities increased by 9% yoy, from ₱253.09 bn as of end-2018 to ₱276.83 bn as of end-2019. the major movements of the accounts leading to the increase were as follows:
a) derivatives liabilities (current and non-current portions) increased by ₱2.31 bn in 2019, due to fair value changes on the group’s foreign currency forward contracts and commodity swap contracts.
b) income tax payable increased by 15% yoy (from ₱439 mn in 2018 to ₱506 mn in 2019), mainly due to expiration of the income tax holidays enjoyed by certain subsidiaries and a corresponding higher current income tax provision.
c) long-term debt (current and non-current portions) increased by 13% yoy (from ₱158.06 bn in 2018 to ₱177.97 bn in 2019), primarily due to the ₱7.25 bn bonds issuance in october 2019.
d) lease liabilities (current and noncurrent portions) decreased by ₱2.10 bn, since tli made timely payments on its obligation with psalm.
e) long-term obligation on power distribution system (pds) decreased by 8% as regular annual payments were made.
f) customers’ deposits increased by ₱513 mn or 9% primarily, driven by growth in customer base of the distribution utilities.
g) other noncurrent liabilities went up from ₱3.18 bn in 2018 to ₱6.81 bn in 2019, mainly due to receipt of proceeds from a damage claim against contractors, which claim is now under dispute.

equity attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company decreased by 2% yoy (from ₱127.71 bn at year-end 2018 to ₱125.54 bn at year-end 2019), after the declaration of dividends in 2019, net of comprehensive income recognized.
a) cumulative translation adjustments decreased by ₱1.52 bn due to downward effect of changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward and commodity swap contracts designed as cash flow hedges; and translation effect of gmcp and luzon hydro corporation (lhc) for the current period.
b) share in cumulative translation adjustments of associates and join ventures decreased by ₱475 mn, mainly due to translation effect of gnpd.
c) acquisition of non-controlling interests for the period pertains to the difference between the purchase price and fair value of net assets acquired in the acquisition of additional partnership interest in gmcp.

cash generated from operations of ₱39.36 bn continued to provide a source of liquidity during 2019, growing by ₱2.07 bn as compared to 2018.
net cash flows used in investing activities increased to ₱34 bn in 2019 from ₱7 bn in 2018, mainly due to funding for the aa thermal acquisition.
despite the cash used to fund acquisition of additional partnership interest in gmcp, the net cash outflows from financing activities amounting to ₱14.38 in 2019 is still lower than 2018. this is due to higher debt availed in 2019.
as of december 31, 2019, the group’s cash and cash equivalents decreased to ₱37.43 bn, compared to ₱46.34 bn as of year-end 2018.

current assets decreased by 13% while current liabilities increased by 10%. the current ratio at year-end 2019 was at 1.50x, versus 1.89x at year-end 2018.
consolidated debt to equity ratio at year-end of 2019 was at 2.07 versus 1.85 as of year-end 2018, as the company’s liabilities have been higher during the year.

aboitizpower is focused on addressing the needs of its markets, namely: (1) reliable supply, at a (2) reasonable cost, and with (3) minimal impact on the environment and communities. the company believes that there is no single technology that completely addresses the country’s energy requirements; and that to address the deficiency, a mix of power generation technologies is necessary. thus, aboitizpower continues to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies where and when it makes sense.
despite increased competition in the power generation market, the company is confident that it has built the foundation to sustain long term growth, as seen in its pipeline of new power generation projects (see part i item 1.(a)(i) on principal products and services - generation of electricity on page 47 of the company’s information statement), where target commercial operation dates for each project are discussed per business unit). the company is on track to reach its target net attributable capacity of 4,000 mw by 2020 with the entry of gnpower dinginin.
aboitizpower’s goal is to grow its capacity to more than 9,000 mw by 2029, which the company expects will be sourced from a portfolio of renewables and selective baseload builds. in terms of renewable energy, the company aims to maximize opportunities from the implementation of the renewable portfolio standards (rps) by doe starting in 2020. in line with doe’s aspirational goal of a 35% increase in renewable energy utilization by 2030, rps is a market- based policy that mandates power distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and res to source an agreed portion of their energy supply from renewable energy facilities. the company will continue to pursue its international aspirations with focus on renewable energy projects in vietnam, indonesia, and myanmar. with all of these combined, it is expected that the company’s portfolio ratio will be close to a 50:50 cleanergy (renewable energy) and thermal energy mix by the end of the current decade.
aboitizpower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. the company expects its financial condition to give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.
the company expects that its existing distribution utilities will continue to realize modest growth. it continuously seeks efficiency and improvements in its distribution utilities’ operations in order to maintain healthy margins.
aboitizpower, together with its partners, has allotted ₱41 bn for capital expenditures in 2020, almost 80% of which is for new businesses such as gnpower dinginin. the remaining balance is allocated mainly for operating and expansion initiatives.
other known trends, events, uncertainties which may have a material impact on aboitizpower have been discussed extensively in sections of the company’s information statement (e.g. for an extensive discussion on regulatory issues, see part i item 1(a) on effects of existing or probable government regulations on the business on page 78 of the company’s information statement).
