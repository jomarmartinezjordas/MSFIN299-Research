share in net earnings in associates and joint ventures for the year 2020 decreased by 30% compared to 2019. the decrease was mainly due to lower income contributions from sn aboitiz power-magat resulting from a reduction in volume sold caused by reduced water levels and gnpd net losses due to foreign-currency denominated loan revaluations.
ebitda for the year of 2020 decreased by 1% yoy. this was due to lower demand resulting from the imposition of covid-19 related quarantine measures. ebitda was also affected by plant outages offset by lower purchased power cost during the year, as well as new capacities.
for the year ended 2020, cash and cash equivalents increased by ₱1.27 bn. this was mainly due to company’s retail bond issuance in july 2020 which was partly offset by principal payments made on existing loans.
current ratio as of december 31, 2020 was at 1.38x as compared to 1.50x as of december 31, 2019. the decline was primarily due to maturing bonds of the company that were reclassified from noncurrent to current during 2020.
debt-to-equity ratio as of december 31, 2020 was at 1.96x, lower than the 2.07x recorded at the end of 2019.

aboitizpower’s net income for 2020 was ₱12.58 bn, 27% lower than the ₱17.32 bn reported in 2019. this translated to earnings per share of ₱1.71 for 2020. the company recognized non-recurring net gains of ₱45 mn during 2020, compared to non-recurring net gains of ₱702 mn during 2019, due to net foreign exchange gains on the revaluation of dollar denominated liabilities. without these one-off gains, the company’s core net income for 2020 was ₱12.53 bn, 25% lower than the ₱16.62 bn recorded in 2019. this was primarily due to additional tax expenses following the expiration of the income tax holiday (ith) incentives of tsi and gmec. the company also de-recognized deferred tax assets on net operating loss carry over (nolco) from 2018 and 2019. there were also additional interest expenses from the company’s bonds and loans that were availed of during late 2019 and the second half of 2020.

aboitizpower’s generation and retail supply business recorded ebitda of ₱37.70 bn in 2020, 4% higher than the ₱36.20 bn recorded in 2019. the variance was primarily due to better availability of the group’s coal facilities and the recognition of bi claims, which offset the lower demand caused by the covid-related community quarantines and lower water inflows to the group’s hydro facilities.
capacity sold during 2020 increased by 7% to 3,417 mw from 3,184 mw in 2019. this resulted from increased contracting levels driven by the new capacity of tvi and additional portfolio contracts. the increase in contracting levels, however, was offset by the lower demand brought about by the pandemic and lower water inflows to the group’s hydro facilities. this resulted in a yoy reduction in energy sold, which declined by 1% to 22,754 gwh for 2020 from 22,942 gwh during 2019.

for 2020, aboitizpower’s distribution business recorded ebitda of ₱7.2 bn, 12% lower than the ₱8.2 bn recorded during 2019. energy sales decreased by 8% to 5,368 gwh in 2020 from 5,851 gwh in 2019. this was due to lower consumption resulting from the enforcement of covid-related community quarantines.

net income attributable to equity holders of the parent company decreased by ₱4.75 bn, or 27%, yoy. the various movements in line items are shown below to account for the decrease:

the decrease in operating revenues during 2020 was primarily due to lower demand brought about by the covid-19 pandemic and resulting community quarantines, lower spot prices and indices, lower contract rates, and lower water inflow.

the decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to the lower cost of purchased power and of generated power brought about by covid-19.

the decrease in interest income during 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower interest rates on
placements.

interest expense increased during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the interest and financing costs on aboitizpower’s ₱7.25 bn and ₱9.55 bn retail bonds issued in october 2019 and july 2020, respectively.

share in net earnings in associates and joint ventures for 2020 decreased by 30% compared to 2019. the decrease was mainly due to lower income contributions from sn aboitiz power-magat, as reduced water levels during 2020 caused a reduction in volume sold, and to a higher share of gnpd’s net losses resulting from foreign-currency denominated loan revaluations.

the increase in other income during 2020 compared to 2019 was mainly due to business interruption insurance claims of tsi due to plant outages.

the increase in provision for taxes during 2020 was due to the additional taxes resulting from the expiration of the ith incentives of tsi and gmec and the derecognition of deferred tax assets on nolco from 2018 and 2019.

total assets (as of december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019) decreased by ₱12.54 bn, or 3%. the major movements of the accounts leading to the decrease were as follows:
a) cash and cash equivalents increased by ₱1.27 bn, or 3% (from ₱37.43 bn to ₱38.70 bn). this was primarily due to the availment of the last tranche of retail bond drawn in july 2020.
b) inventories decreased by ₱324.00 mn, or 5% (from ₱6.63 bn to ₱6.31 bn). this was mainly driven by a decrease in coal inventory during 2020.
c) other current assets decreased by ₱604.00 mn, or 5% (from ₱11.08 bn to ₱10.48 bn). this was mainly driven by the reclassification during 2020 of a portion of tvi’s advances to ngcp to other noncurrent assets.
d) investments and advances increased by ₱950.00 mn, or 2% (from ₱60.88 bn to ₱61.83 bn). this was mainly driven by the new capital contributions to gnpd during 2020.
e) property, plant and equipment decreased by ₱6.07 bn, or 3% (from ₱209.52 bn to ₱203.45 bn). this was primarily due to the depreciation of existing assets.
f) intangible assets decreased by ₱2.43 bn, or 5% (from ₱46.71 bn to ₱44.28 bn). this was primarily due to the amortization of existing assets.
g) net pension assets decreased by ₱18.00 mn, or 26% (from ₱68.00 mn to ₱50.00 mn). this was mainly due the accrual of retirement costs.
h) deferred income tax assets decreased by ₱1.25 bn, or 45% (from ₱2.79 bn to ₱1.54 bn). this was mainly due to the reduction of the deferred tax benefits recognized by tli on its net operating loss.
i) other noncurrent assets decreased by ₱4.25 bn, or 31% (from ₱13.52 bn to ₱9.27 bn). this was mainly due to the decrease in input vat, regular reduction in psalm deferred adjustment, and the reclassification of tvi’s restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents.

compared to december 31, 2019, total liabilities as of december 31, 2020 decreased by ₱13.49 bn, or 5%. the major movements of accounts leading to the decrease were as follows:
a) short-term loans increased by ₱1.41 bn, or 14% (from ₱10.34 bn to ₱11.74 bn). this was mainly due to new loans availed of by the group during 2020 for working capital purposes.
b) trade and other payables decreased by ₱4.00 bn, or 18% (from ₱22.38 bn to ₱18.37 bn). this was primarily due to the reduction of trade payables.
c) income tax payable increased by ₱213.00 mn, or 42% (from ₱510.00 mn to ₱723.00 mn). this was mainly due to the expiration of the ith incentives of tsi and gmec.
d) decommissioning liability increased by ₱1.44 bn, or 40% (from ₱3.57 bn to ₱5.01 bn). this was mainly due to the recognition of additional decommissioning provisions on power plant assets of apri and gmec.
e) long-term debt (current and non-current portions) decreased by ₱650.00 mn (from ₱177.97 bn to ₱177.32 bn). this was mainly due to principal payments made on existing loans and the revaluation of dollar denominated loans, which were partly offset by the parent’s retail bond issuance during 2020.
f) lease liabilities (current and noncurrent portions) decreased by ₱5.53 bn (from ₱44.79 bn to ₱39.26 bn), as tli made timely payments during 2020 of its obligations to psalm.
g) long-term obligation on power distribution system (current and noncurrent portions) decreased by ₱16.00 mn, or 8% (from ₱199.00 mn to ₱183.00 mn), as payments were made in 2020.
h) net derivative liabilities decreased by ₱597 mn (from ₱2.39 bn to ₱1.79 bn) during 2020 due to hedging gains.
i) deferred income tax liabilities decreased by ₱103 mn, or 12% (from ₱848.00 mn to ₱745.00 mn), mainly due to the amortization of franchise assets and increase in the allowances for impairment and probable losses.
j) net pension liabilities decreased by ₱132 mn, or 31% (from ₱426.00 mn to ₱294.00 mn), mainly due to the contributions to the retirement fund during 2020 which were higher than the effect of retirement costs and net actuarial losses.
k) other noncurrent liabilities decreased by ₱5.71 bn, or 84% (from ₱6.81 bn to ₱1.10 bn), mainly due to the regular payments of the psalm deferred adjustments and the settlement of tvi’s other noncurrent liabilities.

equity attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company increased by 1% (from ₱125.54 bn as of december 31, 2019 to ₱127.16 bn as of december 31, 2020) after the declaration of dividends in march 2020, net of comprehensive income recognized during the year of 2020. cumulative translation adjustments decreased by ₱1.45 bn, due to the downward net adjustment in the fair value of the group’s foreign currency forward and commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges, as well as the net assets translation effect of gmec and lhc during 2020.

as of december 31, 2020, the group’s cash and cash equivalents increased by 3% to ₱38.70 bn, from ₱37.43 bn as of december 31, 2019.

net cash flows used in investing activities decreased to ₱4.53 bn in 2020, from ₱34.06 bn i2019, which was mainly due to the ₱24.95 bn aa thermal acquisition taken up during 2019.
the net cash flows used in financing activities as of december 31, 2020 increased by ₱11.54 bn compared to 2019, primarily due to payments by the group of principal amortizations on various loans.

consolidated debt to equity ratio as of december 31, 2020 was at 1.96x, higher than the 2.07x recorded at the end of 2019. this was due to a 5% decrease in total liabilities during 2020, coupled with a 1% increase in equity during the same period.

aboitizpower remains focused on addressing the needs of its markets, namely: (1) providing reliable supply, at a (2) reasonable cost, and with (3) minimal impact on the environment and communities. the company believes that there is no single technology that completely addresses the country’s energy requirements; and that to address the deficiency, a mix of power generation technologies is necessary. thus, aboitizpower continues to pursue both renewable projects and thermal technologies where and when it makes sense.
despite increased competition in the power generation market, the company believes that it has built the foundation to sustain its long term growth, as seen in its pipeline of new power generation projects (see part i item 1.(a)(i) on principal products and services - generation of electricity on page 48 of the company’s 2020 definitive information statement).
as of the end of 2020, aboitizpower owns 4,429 mw of net attributable capacity, of which 3,494 mw is currently operating. the company’s plan is to double its net attributable capacity by the end of the decade, with a target of more than 9,000 mw by 2030. this is expected to come from a portfolio of renewables and selective baseload builds, with the optionality for either coal or gas facilities.
the company aims to maximize opportunities from the implementation of the renewable portfolio standards (“rps”) bythedoestartingin2021. inlinewithdoe’saspirationalgoalofa35%shareinrenewableenergyutilizationby2030, rps is a market-based policy that mandates power distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and retail electricity suppliers to source an agreed portion of their energy supplies from renewable energy facilities. the company will continue to pursue international opportunities, with a continued focus on renewable energy projects in wind, hydro, and solar in high-growth geographic markets with acceptable regulatory environments. with all of these combined, the company aims for its portfolio ratio to be close to a 50:50 renewable energy and thermal capacity mix by the end of the current decade.
aboitizpower fully supports the does’ coal moratorium efforts to make the philippine energy system more flexible, resilient, and sustainable. the company has been a pioneer of renewable energy in the country and currently has the highest megawatts in renewable installed capacity based on market control. its diversification into thermal technologies was primarily driven by the country’s need for a reliable, accessible, and affordable power supply.
aboitizpower believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities arising from developments in the power industry. the company expects its financial condition to give it the agility to create or acquire additional generating capacity over the next few years.
aboitizpower, together with its partners, has alloted ₱23 bn for capital expenditures in 2021, about 70% of which is for expansions and upgrades. these include the remaining investment for the gnpower dinginin construction, as well as for the company’s battery energy storage system projects.
despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic and the currently challenging business situation, the company continues to operate with its business continuity plans in force, in accordance with the protocols and guidelines of the government’s community quarantine. the company will continue to provide the country with the much-needed power supply for hospitals, government institutions, and critical businesses, while ensuring the safety of its teams, partners, and communities.
other known trends, events, uncertainties which may have a material impact on aboitizpower have been discussed extensively in sections of the company’s information statement (e.g. for an extensive discussion on regulatory issues, see effects of existing or probable government regulations on the business on page 80 of the company’s 2020 definitive information statement.
