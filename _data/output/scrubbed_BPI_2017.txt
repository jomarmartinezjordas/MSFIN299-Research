the philippine economy will continue to grow by 6.7% or more in 2018 as government’s planned infrastructure spending go into full swing. the inflation environment in the philippines has remained stable for two consecutive years and is forecasted to accelerate slightly to 3.4% in 2018 as oil prices recover and the initial short-term impact of the tax reform for acceleration and inclusion (train) law implementation takes effect.
the philippine peso is still expected to weaken mildly and gradually versus the major currencies in the medium term given the enormous need for foreign currencies to fund capital spending.
a minimal, if any, monetary policy tightening response is expected from the bsp which could translate to a modest and somewhat healthy increase in domestic interest rates. a sizeable increase in the government’s deficit and borrowing requirement will also exert upward pressure on domestic interest rates but is unlikely to lead to an unmanageable surge in borrowing costs as competition among financial market players continue to intensify.
against this backdrop of a growing economy, bpi will continue to grow its corporate and retail client base. the bank believes its growth will be driven by its strong focus on the country’s growing market of middle class, emergence of small-and-medium-sized enterprises (smes) and the self-employed micro entrepreneurs (seme), and heightened activity of large corporate and government entities. the bank is also positioned to capitalize on more substantial capital flows arising from natural activity in the foreign exchange markets from retail and corporate clients, as well as regulations that increasingly direct flows to more stringently regulated banks.

the economic environment of the country is expected to remain stable in the medium to long term given sustained consumer spending. in contrast to other countries, the philippines has a relatively young population that can drive consumption. the strong domestic market can provide the cushion needed to counter a possible decline in global trade and demand.
nevertheless, consistent growth above 7% can only be achieved if the country’s infrastructure gaps are addressed. lower transportation and electricity costs resulting from infrastructure development will attract foreign businesses to the country, especially those involved in manufacturing. the implementation of the government’s infrastructure program is crucial in expanding the productive capacity of the economy.
in the medium term, bpi intends to capitalize on the philippines’ stable economic growth by further investing in its already significant corporate and retail banking franchises, to make it well-positioned to tap opportunities in (i) the growing market of middle-class filipinos and (ii) thriving smes and (iii) underbanked areas in the microfinance segments, and other opportunities related to increased economic activity and investments from offshore investors, multinational and regional corporations. it also intends to continue to capitalize on the strong cross-selling opportunities to offer the investment banking products of bpi capital to its corporate clients.
the bank intends to leverage its preeminent brand name and continue to innovate and offer value- added products and services to address the complex needs of its clients, while further enhancing client convenience and satisfaction by delivering services through integrated physical, electronic and call center facilities.
the bank will also continue to focus on building its operational and distribution infrastructure. bpi will further strengthen its operational and financial performance through continued investment in process improvements, organizational alignment, management and information systems, and proactive engagement and compensation systems for human resources.
