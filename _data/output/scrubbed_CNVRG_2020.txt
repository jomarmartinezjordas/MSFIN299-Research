for the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized ₱110.9 million as provision for contingencies which represents our best estimate of the probable cost that may arise from certain ongoing operational contingencies in the ordinary course of business.

provision for impairment of trade and other receivables increased by 36.0%, or ₱190.5 million, from ₱529.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 to ₱720.5 million (u.s.$15 million) for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in provisions in 2020 was driven by payment extensions for a certain period to our customers as mandated by the government which resulted in an increase in trade receivables, as well as a more conservative ecl approach, brought about by the continuing impact of covid-19 on our business. to minimize the impact of the pandemic and increase the likelihood to recover receivables from our customers, we offered to some of our customers the ability to settle their outstanding bills in staggered payments. by 2021, we expect provisions to revert to more normal, pre-covid-19 levels.

other income, net increased by 1,864.8%, or ₱342.0 million, from other income, net of ₱18.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 to other income, net of ₱360.3 million (u.s.$7.5 million) for the year ended december 31, 2020. for the year december 31, 2020, other income, net is primarily related to net foreign exchange gain on the strengthening of the philippine peso against the us dollar, and gains from our sale of network materials. also, we had an increase in our interest income from cash and cash equivalents as we had short-term placements during the year. for the year ended, december 31, 2020, we also have interest income from the finance lease receivable arising from our sale and leaseback arrangement with our related parties, and interest income on financial assets at fvtpl, which relates to the exchangeable bond we issued to our ultimate parent. these gains are partially offset by the loss on disposal of our property, plant and equipment.

profit from operations increased by 95.8%, or ₱2,656.7 million, from ₱2,772.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 to ₱5,429.0 million (u.s.$112.5 million) for the year ended december 31, 2020 for the reasons described above, in particular the increase in gross profit, partially offset by the increases in general and administrative expenses and provision for impairment of trade and other receivables.

we are in the process of a significant network expansion program. we have and are continuing to deploy capital expenditures to extend and augment our proprietary end-to-end fiber network, comprising of our domestic backbone, distribution and last-mile networks, and our international connectivity networks. we had aggregate capital expenditures of approximately ₱35.2 billion (u.s.$732.7 million) from 2016 through december 31, 2020.

our capital expenditures were ₱1.2 billion in 2016, ₱2.1 billion in 2017, ₱6.3 billion in 2018, ₱10.0 billion in 2019 and ₱15.6 billion in 2020. in 2021, we currently expect to incur capital expenditures in the aggregate amount of approximately ₱20 billion (u.s.$416.5 million) toward, among other things, further expanding our domestic network (comprising of our domestic backbone, distribution and last mile networks), and securing additional access to international connectivity (including the purchase of 5tbps of international bandwidth capacity from telstra in august 2020). beyond 2021, we expect to incur significant capital expenditures toward our long-term goal of expanding our fiber network to cover 55% of all philippine households (of 27.5 million households, according to mpa) with our network by 2025.

we categorize our capital expenditures as follows:
domestic backbone, which, when completed, will connect the three major philippine islands of luzon, visayas and mindanao in a single continuous loop, with the primary luzon segment already operational as of december 31, 2020, and the primary visayas and mindanao segments expected to be operational by 2021. the domestic backbone comprises of both outside plant equipment, or passive or not electrically powered network equipment (e.g. fiber), and inside plant equipment, or active or electrically powered network equipment (e.g. routers). we estimate our domestic backbone capital expenditures on a per kilometer basis according to the length of the network that we are planning to develop;
distribution network, which connects the domestic backbone with the network access points (“naps”), and the ports mounted on the naps. when entering into a new area, rollout capital expenditure is approximately u.s.$150 per port with subsequent augmentation of additional ports costing approximately u.s.$30 per port. we were able to deploy 1.5 million ports in 2020. we construct poles to support our distribution network, particularly where naps are hoisted. until 2025, the majority of our distribution network rollout will be focused on deepening our penetration in luzon. we estimate our distribution network capital expenditures on a per homes passed basis according to the number of homes passed additions that we have targeted. we also estimate the number of additional poles that our distribution network will require and the expected capital expenditure per pole;
customer premise equipment (“cpe”), which are the modems and routers provided to residential subscribers. the cost for each cpe for a ftth subscriber is approximately u.s.$70, and it is depreciated over three years. the annual cpe cost that we incur is directly correlated to the volume of gross residential subscriber additions in a given year;
international connectivity, which connects our domestic network with key international networks. we actively seek to form partnerships with global carriers in order to secure proprietary access to bandwidth capacity on certain key international network routes. for example, in august 2020, we entered into an agreement with telstra international limited to purchase 5tbps of international bandwidth capacity, providing a 15-year iru on two major intra-asia networks for an attractive cost. this 5tbps of bandwidth capacity is equivalent to approximately seven times our current leased bandwidth capacity, and has been priced at an aggregate unit cost that is meaningfully lower compared to our average contracted lease costs at present. this iru is subject to certain conditions. going forward, converge intends to continue to secure proprietary access to international bandwidth capacity through similar agreements with other international carriers, which can provide us with significant cost savings; and
other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, such as it systems and software. in 2020, our capital expenditures were allocated as follows:
60% to our outside plant equipment, or passive or not electrically powered network equipment, related to the construction of our proprietary end-to-end fiber network. these include investments into fiber-optic cables, the construction of our domestic backbone and distribution networks, including the construction of poles, the installation of network access points and ports.
18% to our inside plant equipment, or active or electrically powered network equipment, related to the construction of our proprietary end-to-end fiber network. this includes dense wavelength division multiplexing (“dwdm”) equipment and routers for activating the network buildout discussed in the outside plant equipment above.
12% to our customer premises equipment, which are the modems and routers provided to residential subscribers.
10% to other capex, which include right-of-use assets, intangible assets, transportation and heavy equipment, land, office equipment and furniture, leasehold improvements and tools and facility equipment

we did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that were likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

we are exposed to the market risks in the course of our normal business activities. these market risks principally involve the possibility of adverse consequences on our results of operations due to factors that generally beyond our control. the most important types of risk the company manages are credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
