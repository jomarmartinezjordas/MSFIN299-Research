full year consolidated service revenues reached ₱127.9 billion in 2017 from ₱120.6 billion last year due to the increasing popularity of globe's data-related product and services across all business segments. mobile revenues were up 7% to ₱98.5 billion from last year's ₱92.3 billion, coming mostly from globe prepaid (+11%), and the company's mass market brand tm (+8%), due to increased data consumption and improved top-ups despite lower cumulative customer base. home broadband and corporate data likewise, sustained their growth momentum, posting a 7% and 4% increase from a year ago respectively, due to the strong subscriber growth and increasing demand for faster data connectivity and corporate internet solutions.
total operating expenses and subsidy increased by 6% year-on-year to ₱74.6 billion from ₱70.6 billion a year ago. this was mainly driven by increases across all expense line items (except for subsidy, interconnect costs and marketing expenses) to support globe's aggressive data network expansion and overall service enhancements.
globe’s consolidated ebitda reached ₱53.3 billion, surpassing last year’s level of ₱50.0 billion, due mainly to the strong topline. ebitda margin for 2017 was at 42%, higher versus last year’s margin of 41%, as the overall revenue gains fully covered for the increase in expenses
total depreciation expenses posted a 15% increase to ₱27.5 billion from the ₱23.8 billion reported in 2016, given the depreciation costs of incremental asset builds related to globe’s 2016 and 2017 capital expenditure programs.
overall, total operating costs including depreciation charges rose to p102.1 billion or 8% higher than the ₱94.5 billion reported in 2016.
non-operating charges increased year-on-year by 2% to ₱4.3 billion in 2017 from the ₱4.2 billion reported a year ago, mainly on higher interest expenses and spectrum amortization related to the smc telco asset acquisition booked during the period. this however, was partly cushioned by the one-time gain booked last september, related to the fair value of retained equity interest of globe in globe fintech innovations, inc. (gfi/mynt). in addition, increase in interest expense as of end december 2017 was due to this year’s higher interest expense on higher loan balance.
the globe group closed the year with consolidated net income of ₱15.1 billion, down 5% from previous year’s ₱15.9 billion due mainly to higher depreciation expenses and increased non- operating charges booked during the year, as we recognized the full year impact of the additional costs related to the smc telco asset acquisition.
globe’s core net income, which excludes the impact of non-recurring charges, one-time gain, foreign exchange gains and mark-to-market charges, stood at ₱13.5 billion, down by 15% year-on- year.
as of end-december 2017, total cash capital expenditures stood at about ₱42.5 billion (approximately $844 million), 16% higher than last year's level of ₱36.7 billion. the increase in capital expenditures was partially driven by the delay in capex cash flows in the latter part of 2016, which spilled into 2017 coupled with the company's continued aggressive network expansion. to date, globe has a total of 37,517 base stations, with over 24,700 for 4g, to support the service requirements of its customers.

the globe group ended the year with total operating revenues of ₱135.3 billion, up 7% from close to ₱126.8 billion recorded last year. this was driven by robust service revenue growth, which was up 6% year-on-year to reach ₱127.9 billion from ₱120.6 billion a year ago
mobile service revenues, which accounted for 77% of globe’s consolidated service revenues for the year just ended, rose to ₱98.5 billion, up a robust 7% from last year’s level of ₱92.3 billion, due to the continued strong revenue contributions from mobile data (+23%) as partly offset by the decline in traditional voice.
globe group’s fixed line and home broadband revenues posted a 4% increase year-on-year from ₱28.3 billion in 2016 to ₱29.4 billion in 2017. the growth was driven by solid contributions of both home broadband and corporate data segments.

mobile voice revenues, which accounted for 33% of total mobile service revenues, declined by 5% to only ₱32.3 billion in 2017 from ₱34.1 billion in 2016. consistent with global trends, voice revenues remain challenged given the migration of voice traffic to alternative internet-based applications, such as viber, facebook, skype, and whatsapp, among others.

a. globe prepaid
globe prepaid gross acquisitions grew by 3% year-on-year from the 24.6 million gross additions in 2016. the year-on-year improvement in gross additions was driven by the brand’s continued acquisition efforts and the strong take-up of value-for-money data bundles. total net reduction in subscribers stood at 525 thousand as of end-december 2017 compared to the 2.5 million net incremental subs in 2016 due mainly to the increased churn rate (from 6.8% in 2016 to 7.7% in 2017). total cumulative globe prepaid subscribers reached 27.9 million as of end december 2017, down 2% from a year ago. increase in churn rate was due mainly to the shift in subscriber recognition in 2017, excluding those who do not reload within 90 days of the second expiry period.

b. tm
tm’s gross acquisitions on the other hand, slightly declined year-on-year by 1%, reaching 28.1 million in 2017 from the previous year’s 28.5 million. due to the increased churn rates as of end-december 2017 (from 6.8% in 2016 to 8.0% this period), total net reduction in subscribers stood at 1.6 million this period compared to 4.2 million net incremental subs in 2016. tm cumulative subscriber base stood at 30.3 million subscribers at the end of december 2017, down 5% from the 31.9 million subscribers a year ago. similar to globe prepaid, the increased churn this period was mainly due to the change in the basis for reporting subscribers (as stated above).
tm arpu likewise followed the same trajectory as globe prepaid, ending the year with an arpu of ₱66, up by 5% against 2016 and sac of ₱13, flat versus a year ago.

globe group’s fixed line and home broadband revenues posted a 4% increase year-on-year from ₱28.3 billion in 2016 to ₱29.4 billion in 2017. the growth was driven by solid contributions of both home broadband and corporate data segments.
globe home broadband posted 7% growth to reach ₱15.6 billion in the year just ended from ₱14.7 billion reported a year ago, as a result of sustained expansion of its customer base mainly from the growth in fixed wireless services (up 26% year-on-year). the revenue growth and customer uptake throughout the year was partially driven by the relevant and compelling new globe home broadband bundles and packages. this was likewise supported by the higher subscriber base, rising to 1.3 million subscribers or 15% increase year-on-year.
in the last quarter of the year, globe at home has committed itself to transforming home entertainment from strict schedules to making primetime your time through its high-speed internet and partnerships with world class content partners. through globe at home’s partnership with fox networks group, customers can experience a wider variety of content (latest hollywood movies, tv shows, live sports and more) with globe streamwatch roku powered’s collaboration with fox+1. customers now have access to fox+ for 3 months using globe streamwatch roku powered device. globe streamwatch roku powered device can be availed by adding ₱50 for 24 months to a globe at home plan or a one- time payment of ₱999.

globe’s total fixed line voice revenues on the other hand, declined year-on-year by 8%.

globe’s ild voice revenues from the mobile and fixed line businesses declined year-on-year by 14% from ₱9.6 billion last year to ₱7.8 billion this period. this is attributed to the continued migration of international traffic through alternative channels that make use of internet-based applications (viber, skype, line, yahoo, etc.).
meanwhile, globe sustained its promotion on ofw sim packs and the discounted call rate offers such as idd sakto calls (per-second idd), tipidd card, and idd tingi – the first bulk idd service which can be purchased via registration and through amax retailers nationwide.

globe ended the year with total costs and expenses at p=102.1 billion or 8% higher from p=94.5 billion a year ago, bulk coming from depreciation, staff cost, repairs and maintenance and provisions. higher network related expenses for the period was mainly to support the continued enhancement of globe network’s data capacities.

interconnect charges for the year declined by 18% to only ₱7.9 billion from the ₱9.6 billion in 2016, driven by the drop in interconnection rate to ₱2.50 coupled with lower inter-network traffic usages of domestic promo offers, outbound regular streams and outbound roaming.
subsidy expenses slightly declined by 1% from ₱5.7 billion reported a year ago due to the continued slow-down in postpaid acquisitions and higher number of subscribers availing of line-only plans.

accounting for 7% of total operating expenses and subsidy, selling, advertising, and promotion expenses declined by 6% to only ₱5.4 billion from ₱5.7 billion a year ago, driven mainly by lower online and media placements, tv airtime, sponsorships and merchandising materials as well as lower commissions.

globe’s re-contracting costs for the year slightly grew by 1% from the ₱3.6 billion posted last year. re- contracting costs for the year accounted for 5% of total operating expenses and subsidy.
staff costs increased by 21% to ₱12.2 billion in 2017 from ₱10.1 billion in 2016 mainly due to higher variable incentive pay related to 2016 payout and higher accrual for corporate incentives this year.

utilities, supplies, and other administrative expenses, which contribute 7% of total operating expenses and subsidy, also reported an increase of 4%, totaling ₱5.2 billion from the ₱5.0 billion reported in 2016. the increase was mainly driven by utilities, on higher electricity charges due to the 12% increase in rate (from ly’s ₱8.29 kwh),coupled with incremental sites and new corporate offices; partly offset by lower supplies costs on product peripherals and sli materials and lower travel expenses.

rent expenses for the year 2017 was at ₱6.5 billion, a 10% increase from ₱5.9 billion reported a year ago. this accounts for 9% of total operating expenses and subsidy. the growth in lease expenses was mainly on international leases on incremental capacities to support data-related requirements, increase in the number of leased cell sites, co-location, joint pole, service vehicle and corporate offices.

this account includes provisions related to trade, non-trade and traffic receivables and inventory. overall, provisions account for 7% of total operating expenses and subsidy. total provisions for the year increased to ₱5.1 billion, 57% higher than the ₱3.3 billion reported in 2016. the increase was mainly on higher trade due to the additional provisions booked this year, higher inventory provisions due to increased refurbished stocks, defective handsets, modems and sim packs (e.g. non-lte sims), partly offset by lower traffic provisions this period.

repairs and maintenance costs for the year stood at ₱7.8 billion, a 24% increase from the ₱6.3 billion reported a year ago. this was largely coming from premium content payout (spotifyt, nba, disney, hooq, and netflix). in addition, globe also incurred higher communication equipment maintenance cost, supplies facilities and subscriber line maintenance, partly offset by lower international cable system. all in all, repairs and maintenance accounted for 10% of total operating expenses and subsidy.

accounting for 20% of total operating expenses and subsidy, services and expenses slightly declined by 1% from ₱15.4 billion in 2016 driven by lower subscriber line installation services following lower acquisitions coupled with lower professional/advisory fees.

depreciation and amortization expenses for the year grew 15% to ₱27.5 billion from ₱23.8 billion reported in 2016. this was largely driven by increased depreciation costs of incremental asset builds related to globe’s 2016 and 2017 capital expenditure programs.

the globe group’s non-operating charges increased year-on-year by 2% to ₱4.3 billion in 2017 from the ₱4.2 billion reported a year ago, mainly on higher interest expenses and spectrum amortization related to the smc telco asset acquisition booked during the period. this however, was partly cushioned by the one-time gain booked this year, related to the fair value of retained equity interest of globe in globe fintech innovations, inc. (gfi/mynt). in addition, increase in interest expense as of end december 2017 was due to this year’s higher interest expense on higher loan balance.

globe’s balance sheet and cash flows remain strong with ample liquidity and gearing below bank
covenants.
globe group’s consolidated assets as of 31 december 2017 amounted to ₱277.8 billion compared to nearly ₱250.0 billion in 2016. consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short term investments (including investments in assets available for sale and held to maturity investments) reached close to ₱11.2 billion as of end december of 2017 compared to ₱8.6 billion as of end december 2016.
on a consolidated basis, globe ended the year with gross debt to equity ratio of 1.98:1 and is still within the 2.5:1 debt to equity limit dictated by globe’s debt covenants. meanwhile, net debt to equity ratio was at 1.81:1 as of end december 2017 and 1.53:1 as of end december 2016.
globe’s current ratio was at 0.72:1 as of 31 december 2017 and 0.64:1 as of 31 december 2016, which are at par with industry standards. while globe’s average current ratio was below the sec’s minimum of 1:1, globe believes it has more than sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its debt maturities, currently and prospectively.
the financial tests under globe’s loan agreements include compliance with the following ratios:
total debt* to equity not exceeding 2.5:1;
total debt to ebitda not exceeding 3:1;
debt service coverage2 exceeding 1.3 times; and secured debt ratio3 not exceeding 0.2 times.
*composed of notes payable, current portion long term debt, long term debt and net derivative liabilities
as of 31 december 2017, globe is well within the ratios prescribed under its loan agreements.

net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year just ended was at ₱50.3 billion which grew by 34% year-on-year.
meanwhile, net cash used in investing activities amounted to ₱55.4 billion, 4% lower than last year. consolidated cash capital expenditures as of end of december 2017 amounted to ₱42.5 billion, up by 16% from last year’s ₱36.7 billion.

consolidated net cash provided by financing activities amounted to ₱7.8 billion in 2017 versus last year’s net cash used of nearly ₱17.0 billion for financing activities in 2016. consolidated total debt, likewise, increased by 24% from ₱105.7 billion at the end of 2016 to reach ₱131.5 billion at the end of december 2017.
84% of us$ consolidated loans have been effectively converted to php via us$335 million in currency hedges. after swaps, effectively 2% of conso debt is in usd.
below is the schedule of debt maturities for consolidated globe for the years stated below based on total outstanding debt as of 31 december 2017:

globe telecom has unsecured term loans and corporate notes, which consist of fixed and floating rate notes and dollar and peso-denominated term loans. the term loans bear interest at stipulated and prevailing market rates. globe group also has a secured debt amounting to usd2.54 million as of december 31, 2017, arising from its acquisition of bti (see note 3 of the attached consolidated financial statement).
the globe group has available uncommitted short-term credit facilities of usd118.90 million and ₱19.50 billion as of december 31, 2017 and usd80.40 million and ₱13.45 billion, as of december 31, 2016.

the globe group also has available committed short-term credit facilities of ₱3.00 billion and ₱1.20 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
outstanding short-term notes payable from various local and foreign banks amounted to nil and ₱4.50 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
these short-term loans have maturities ranging from 1 to 3 months and bear interest ranging from 2.4% to 3.25%.
stockholders’ equity as of end-december 2017 was higher by 5% from ₱63,476 million to ₱66,558 million this period. globe’s capital stock consists of the following:
voting preferred shares
voting preferred stock at a par value of ₱5 per share of which 158.5 million shares are outstanding out of a total authorized of 160 million shares.
the dividends for voting preferred stock are declared upon the sole discretion of the globe telecom’s bod.
to date, none of the voting preferred shares have been converted to common shares.

non-voting preferred stock at a par value of ₱50 per share of which 20 million shares are issued out of a total authorized of 40 million shares.

common shares at par value of ₱50 per share of which 132.9 million are issued and outstanding out of a total authorized of 149 million shares.

the dividend policy of globe telecom as approved by the board of directors is to declare cash dividends to its common stockholders on a regular basis as may be determined by the board. the dividend payout rate is reviewed annually by the board of directors, taking into account the company’s operating results, cash flows, debt covenants, capital expenditure levels and liquidity.
on november 8, 2011, the board of directors amended the company’s dividend policy to be based on core instead of reported net income. pay-out range remains at 75% to 90%. this is to ensure that dividends will remain sustainable and yields competitive despite the expected near-term decline in net income that would result from the accelerated depreciation charges related to assets that will be decommissioned as part of the company’s network and it transformation programs which were ongoing during the time. as currently defined, core net income excludes all foreign exchange, mark-to-market gains and losses, as well as non-recurring items.
on august 6, 2013, the board of directors approved the proposed change in the frequency of the cash dividend distribution from semi-annual to quarterly. on december 10, 2013, the bod approved to defer the implementation of the quarterly dividend payout to the second semester of 2014.
on may 9, 2017, the board of directors of globe approved the declaration of the second semi-annual cash dividend for holders of its non-voting preferred shares on record as of august 10, 2017. the amount of the cash dividend shall be at a fixed rate of 5.2006% per annum calculated in respect of each share by reference to the offer price of ₱500.00 per share on a 30/360 day basis for the six-month dividend period. total amount of the cash dividend will be paid on august 22, 2017.
the board of directors of globe approved in separate approvals the declaration of four quarterly distributions of cash dividends of ₱22.75 per common share paid each last march 8, june 7, september 6 and december 1, 2017. each cash dividend payments total about ₱3.0 billion, bringing total distribution by the end of december 2017 to ₱12.0 billion.
on november 3, 2017, the bod likewise approved the declaration of annual cash dividend payable to voting preferred stockholders of record as of november 17, 2017. the amount of the cash dividend was based on the average 30-day pdst-r2, as computed by the philippine dealing and exchange corporation plus 2%. total dividend payment made last december 1, 2017 was about ₱33.7 million.
on december 5, 2017, globe’s bod approved the declaration and payment of the first semi-annual cash dividends for the company’s non-voting preferred shareholders on record as of january 26, 2018. the amount of the cash dividend was at a fixed rate of 5.2006% per annum calculated in respect of each share by reference to the offer price of ₱500.00 per share on a 30/360 day basis for the six-month dividend period. payment date is on february 22, 2018.

consolidated return on average equity (roe) registered at 23% as of end-december 2017, compared to 26% in 2016 using net income and based on average equity balances for the year ended. using annualized core net income excluding the effects of non-recurring expenses, foreign exchange loss, one-time gains on net income, return on average equity for the year just ended was at 21% compared to 26% of 2016.

consolidated basic earnings per common share were ₱109.22 and ₱115.45, while consolidated diluted earnings per common share were ₱109.01 and ₱115.27 as of end-december 2017 and 2016, respectively.

foreign exchange risks are managed such that usd inflows from operations (transaction exposures) are balanced or offset by the net usd liability position of the company (translation exposures). globe group’s objective is to maintain a position which results in, as close as possible, a neutral effect to the p&l relative to movements in the foreign exchange market.

globe has natural net us$ inflows arising from its operations. consolidated foreign currency-linked revenues1 were at 10% and 12% of total service revenues for the periods ended 31 december 2017 and 2016, respectively. in contrast, globe’s foreign-currency linked expenses were at 13% and 14% of total operating expenses for the same periods ended, respectively.
due to these net us$ inflows, an appreciation of the peso has a negative impact on globe’s peso ebitda. globe occasionally enters into forward contracts to hedge against a peso appreciation.
there were no realized gains or losses from forward contracts in 2017. there were no outstanding forward contracts as of december 2017.

globe’s foreign exchange translation exposures result primarily from movements of the philippine peso (php) against the u.s. dollars (usd) with respect to usd-denominated financial assets, usd- denominated financial liabilities and certain usd-denominated revenues. majority of revenues are generated in peso. in addition, 15% of debt as of december 31, 2017 are denominated in usd before taking into account any swaps and hedges.
globe also has us$ assets and liabilities which are revalued at market rates every period.
as of end-december 2017, the globe group posted a total of ₱214 million net foreign exchange gain.
the globe group‘s foreign exchange risk management policy is to maintain a hedged financial position, after taking into account expected usd flows from operations and financing transactions. globe telecom enters into short-term foreign currency forwards and long-term foreign currency swap contracts in order to achieve this target.
as of end-december, globe has us$240 million in cross currency swap contracts which are hedges of the interest and foreign exchange risks of some of our us$ loans maturing in april 2020, august 2024 and august 2027. the mtm of the outstanding swap contracts stood at a gain of ₱561 million as of end-december 2017.

as of end-december, globe has us$95.1 million in principal only swap contracts which are hedges of the foreign exchange risks of some of our us$ loans maturing in april 2020, april 2022 and october 2022. the mtm of the swap contracts stood at a gain of ₱141 million as of end-december 2017.

interest rate exposures are managed via targeted levels of fixed versus floating rate debt that are meant to achieve a balance between cost and volatility. globe’s policy is to maintain between 44-88% of its peso debt in fixed rate, and between 31-62% of its us$ debt in fixed rate.
as of end-december 2017, globe has a total of us$63 million in us$ interest swaps and us$240 million in cross currency swaps that were entered in to contracts to achieve these targets. the us$ swaps fixed some of the company’s outstanding floating rate debts with semi-annual payment intervals up to april 2020, and quarterly payment intervals up to october 2022, august 2024, and august 2027.
as of end-december 2017, 83% (excluding short-term debt) of peso debt is fixed, while 41% of usd debt is fixed after swaps.
the mtm of the interest rate swap contracts (not including swap contracts) stood at a gain of ₱27 million as of end-december 2017.

outstanding credit exposures from financial instruments are monitored daily and allowable exposures are reviewed quarterly.
for investments, the globe group does not have investments in foreign securities (bonds, collateralized debt obligations (cdo), collateralized mortgage obligations (cmo), or any instruments linked to the mortgage market in the us). globe’s excess cash is invested in short term bank deposits.
the globe group also does not have any investments or hedging transactions with investment banks. derivative transactions as of the end of the period are with large foreign and local banks. furthermore, the globe group does not have instruments in its portfolio which became inactive in the market nor does the company have any structured notes which require use of judgment for valuation purposes.

the company uses valuation techniques that are commonly used by market participants and that have been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions. the company uses readily observable market yield curves to discount future receipts and payments on the transactions. the net present value of receipts and payments are translated into peso using the foreign exchange rate at time of valuation to arrive at the mark to market value. for derivative instruments with optionality, the company relies on valuation reports of its counterparty banks, which are the company’s best estimates of the close-out value of the transactions.
gains (losses) on derivative instruments represent the net mark-to-market (mtm) gains (losses) on derivative instruments. as of 31 december 2017, the mtm value of the derivatives of the globe group amounted to a gain of ₱735 million while net gain on derivative instruments arising from changes in mtm reflected in the consolidated income statements amounted to ₱128 million.
to measure riskiness, the company provides a sensitivity analysis of its profit and loss from financial instruments resulting from movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. the interest rate sensitivity estimates the changes to the following p&l items, given an indicated movement in interest rates: (1) interest income, (2) interest expense, (3) mark-to-market of derivative instruments. the foreign exchange sensitivity estimates the p&l impact of a change in the usd/php rate as it specifically pertains to the revaluation of the net unhedged liability position of the company, and foreign exchange derivatives.

1. any events that will trigger direct or contingent financial obligation that is material to the company, including any default or acceleration of an obligation:
contingencies
a. on october 10, 2011, the ntc issued memorandum circular no. 02-10-2011 titled interconnection charge for short messaging service requiring all public telecommunication entities to reduce their interconnection charge to each other from ₱0.35 to ₱0.15 per text, which globe telecom complied as early as november 2011. on december 11, 2011, the ntc one stop public assistance center (ospac) filed a complaint against globe telecom, smart and digitel alleging violation of the said mc no. 02-10-2011 and asking for the reduction of sms off-net retail price from ₱1.00 to ₱0.80 per text. globe telecom filed its answer maintaining the position that the reduction of the sms interconnection charges does not automatically translate to a reduction in the sms retail charge per text.
on november 20, 2012, the ntc rendered a decision directing globe telecom to:
1. reduce its regular sms retail rate from ₱1.00 to not more than ₱0.80;
2. refund/reimburse its subscribers the excess charge of ₱0.20; and
3. pay a fine of ₱200.00 per day from december 1, 2011 until date of compliance.
on may 7, 2014, ntc denied the motion for reconsideration (mr) filed by globe telecom last december 5, 2012 in relation to the november 20, 2012 decision. globe telecom’s assessment is that globe telecom is in compliant with the ntc memorandum circular no. 02-10-2011. on june 9, 2014, globe telecom filed petition for review of the ntc decision and resolution with the court of appeals (ca).
the ca granted the petition in a resolution dated september 3, 2014 by issuing a 60-day temporary restraining order against memorandum circular 02-10-2011 by the ntc. on october 15, 2014, globe telecom posted a surety bond to compensate for possible damages as directed by the ca.
on june 27, 2016, the ca rendered a decision reversing the ntc’s abovementioned decision and resolution requiring telecommunications companies to cut their sms rates and return the excess amount paid by subscribers. the ca said that the ntc order was baseless as there is no showing that the reduction in the sms rate is mandated under mc no. 02-10-2011; there is no showing, either that the present p1.00 per text rate is unreasonable and unjust, as this was not mandated under the memorandum. moreover, under the ntc’s own mc no. 02-05-2008, sms is a value added service (vas) whose rates are deregulated.
thereafter, the ntc and bayan muna party list (bayan muna) representatives neri javier colmenares and carlos isagani zarate, who, in the meantime, had intervened in the case, filed their respective motions for reconsideration, which motions were both denied by the ca.
the ntc thus elevated the ca’s ruling to the supreme court (sc) via a petition for review on certiorari dated 15 september 2017. globe awaits the sc’s action on said petition.
for its part, bayan muna filed its own petition for review on certiorari of the ca’s decision. on 04 january 2018, globe received a copy of the sc’s resolution dated 06 nov. 2017, requiring it to comment on said petition.
globe telecom believes that it did not violate ntc mc no. 02-10-2011 when it did not reduce its sms retail rate from php 1.00 to php 0.80 per text, and hence, would not be obligated to refund its subscribers. however, if it is ultimately decided by the supreme court (in case an appeal is taken thereto by the ntc from the adverse resolution of the ca) that globe telecom is not compliant with said circular, globe may be contingently liable to refund to its subscribers the ₱0.20 difference (between ₱1.00 and ₱0.80 per text) reckoned from november 20, 2012 until said decision by the sc becomes final and executory. management does not have an estimate of the potential claims currently.
b. on july 23, 2009, the ntc issued ntc memorandum circular (mc) no. 05-07-2009 (guidelines on unit of billing of mobile voice service). the mc provides that the maximum unit of billing for the cmts whether postpaid or prepaid shall be six (6) seconds per pulse. the rate for the first two (2) pulses, or equivalent if lower period per pulse is used, may be higher than the succeeding pulses to recover the cost of the call set-up. subscribers may still opt to be billed on a one (1) minute per pulse basis or to subscribe to unlimited service offerings or any service offerings if they actively and knowingly enroll in the scheme.
on december 28, 2010, the court of appeals (ca) rendered its decision declaring null and void and reversing the decisions of the ntc in the rates applications cases for having been issued in violation of globe telecom and the other carriers’ constitutional and statutory right to due process. however, while the decision is in globe telecom’s favor, there is a provision in the decision that ntc did not violate the right of petitioners to due process when it declared via circular that the per pulse billing scheme shall be the default.
last january 21, 2011, globe telecom and two other telecom carriers, filed their respective motions for partial reconsideration (mr) on the pronouncement that “the per pulse billing scheme shall be the default”. the petitioners and the ntc filed their respective motion for reconsideration, which were all denied by the ca on january 19, 2012.
on march 12, 2012, globe and innove elevated to the supreme court the questioned portions of the decision and resolution of the ca dated december 28, 2010 and its resolution dated january 19, 2012. the other service providers, as well as the ntc, filed their own petitions for review. the adverse parties have filed their comments on each other’s petitions, as well as their replies to each other’s comments. the case is now submitted for resolution.
c. on 22 may 2006, innove received a copy of the complaint of subic telecom company (subictel), inc., a subsidiary of pldt, seeking an injunction to stop the subic bay metropolitan authority and innove from taking any actions to implement the certificate of public convenience and necessity granted by sbma to innove. subictel claimed that the grant of a cpcn allowing innove to offer certain telecommunications services within the subic bay freeport zone would violate the joint venture agreement (jva) between pldt and sbma.
the supreme court ordered the reinstatement of the case and has forwarded it to the ntc olongapo for trial. the case is now being tried before the olongapo rtc.
on july 13, 2016, the regional trial court (rtc) in olongapo rendered its decision dismissing subictel’s complaint, as nothing in the jva cited by subictel supports its claim of exclusivity. moreover, the constitution clearly provides that no franchise or authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be exclusive in character. subictel did not move for a reconsideration of the rtc’s decision. on october 19, 2016, innove received a copy of subictel’s petition for review to the supreme court dated september 13, 2016 assailing the trial court’s decision.
in a resolution dated april 25, 2017, received by globe on july 3, 2017, the supreme court denied the petition for failure of the petitioner to sufficiently show that the rtc committed any reversible error in the challenged decision as to warrant the exercise of the court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction.
d. (1) pldt and its affiliate, bonifacio communications corporation (bcc) and innove and globe telecom are in litigation over the right of innove to render services and build telecommunications infrastructure in the bonifacio global city (bgc). in the case filed by innove before the ntc against bcc, pldt and the fort bonifacio development corporation (fbdc), the ntc has issued a cease and desist order preventing bcc from performing further acts to interfere with innove's installations in the bgc.
on january 21, 2011, bcc and pldt filed with the ca a petition for certiorari and prohibition against the ntc, et al. seeking to annul the order of the ntc dated october 28, 2008 directing bcc, pldt and fbdc to comply with the provisions of ntc mc 05-05-02 and to cease and desist from performing further acts that will prevent innove from implementing and providing telecommunications services in the fort bonifacio global city pursuant to the authorization granted by the ntc.
on april 25, 2011, innove communications filed its comment on the petition.
on august 16, 2011, the ca ruled that the petition against innove and the ntc lacked merit, holding that neither bcc nor pldt could claim the exclusive right to install telecommunications infrastructure and providing telecommunications services within the bgc. thus, the ca denied the petition and dismissed the case. pldt and bcc filed their motions for reconsideration thereto, which the ca denied.
on july 6, 2012, pldt and bcc assailed the ca’s rulings via a petition for review on certiorari with the supreme court. innove and globe filed their comment on said petition on january 14, 2013, to which said petitioners filed their reply on may 21, 2013. the case remains pending with the supreme court.
(2) in a case filed by pldt against the ntc in branch 96 of the rtc of quezon city (qc), where pldt sought to obtain an injunction to prevent the ntc from hearing the case filed by innove, the rtc denied the prayer for a preliminary injunction and the case has been set for further hearings. pldt has filed a motion for reconsideration and globe telecom has intervened in this case. in a resolution dated october 28, 2008, the rtc qc denied bcc‘s motion for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (tro) on the ground that the ntc has primary administrative jurisdiction over the case. on october 14, 2013, the rtc issued an order dismissing the case. on november 12, 2013, pldt elevated the case to the ca. on july 25, 2016, the ca granted pldt’s petition, holding that the trial court had jurisdiction, since the issues raised by pldt were supposedly purely legal in character. on august 17, 2016, the ntc through the office of the solicitor general (osg) moved for a reconsideration of the ca’s decision. on january 10, 2017, the ca issued a resolution denying ntc’s motion for reconsideration.
on march 10, 2017, the ntc elevated the case to the sc via a petition for review on certiorari dated march 6, 2017. pldt subsequently filed its comment thereon dated july 10, 2017. the ntc thereafter filed its reply to said comment dated december 05, 2017.
(3) in a case filed by bcc against fbdc, globe telecom, and innove before the regional trial court of pasig, which case sought to enjoin innove from making any further installations in the bgc and claimed damages from all the parties for the breach of the exclusivity of bcc in the area, the court did not issue a tro and has instead scheduled several hearings on the case. the defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of forum shopping and lack of jurisdiction, among others. on march 30, 2012, the rtc of pasig, as prayed for, dismissed the complaint on the aforesaid grounds.
the motion for reconsideration filed by bcc on july 20, 2012 remains pending with the trial court.
e. in a letter dated june 7, 2016 issued by the philippine competition commission (pcc) to globe telecom, pldt, smc, and vti regarding the joint notice filed by the aforementioned parties on may 30, 2016, disclosing the acquisition by globe telecom and pldt of the entire issue and outstanding shares of vti, the pcc claims that the notice was deficient in form and substance and concludes that the acquisition cannot be claimed to be deemed approved.
on june 10, 2016, globe telecom formally responded to the letter reiterating that the notice, which sets forth the salient terms and conditions of the transaction, was filed pursuant to and in accordance with memorandum circular no. l6-002 (mc no. l6-002) issued by the pcc. mc no. 16-002 provides that before the implementing rules and regulations for republic act no. 10667 (the philippine competition act of 2015) come into full force and effect, upon filing with the pcc of a notice in which the salient terms and conditions of an acquisition are set forth, the transaction is deemed approved by the pcc and as such, it may no longer be challenged. further, globe telecom clarified in its letter that the supposed deficiency in form and substance of the notice is not a ground to prevent the transaction from being deemed approved. the only exception to the rule that a transaction is deemed approved is when a notice contains false material information. in this regard, globe telecom stated that the notice does not contain any false information.
on june 17, 2016, globe telecom received a copy of the second letter issued by pcc stating that notwithstanding the position of globe telecom, it was ruling that the transaction was still subject for review.
on july 12, 2016, globe telecom asked the ca to stop the government's anti-trust body from reviewing the acquisition of smc's telecommunications business. globe telecom maintains the position that the deal was approved after globe telecom notified the pcc of the transaction and that the anti-trust body violated its own rules by insisting on a review. on the same day, globe telecom filed a petition for mandamus, certiorari and prohibition against the pcc, docketed as ca-g.r. sp no. 146538. on july 25, 2016, the ca, through its 6th division issued a resolution denying globe telecom’s application for tro and injunction against pcc’s review of the transaction. in the same resolution, however, the ca required the pcc to comment on globe telecom's petition for certiorari and mandamus within 10 days from receipt thereof. the pcc filed said comment on august 8, 2016. in said comment, the pcc prayed that the ₱70 billion deal between pldt-globe telecom and san miguel be declared void for pldt and globe telecom’s alleged failure to comply with the requirements of the philippine competition act of 2015. the pcc also prayed that the ca direct globe telecom to: cease and desist from further implementing its co-acquisition of the san miguel telecommunications assets; undo all acts consummated pursuant to said acquisition; and pay the appropriate administrative penalties that may be imposed by the pcc under the philippine competition act for the illegal consummation of the subject acquisition. the case remains pending with the ca.
meanwhile, pldt filed a similar petition with the ca, docketed as ca g.r. sp no. 146528, which was raffled off to its 12th division. on august 26, 2016, pldt secured a tro from said court. thereafter, globe telecom’s petition was consolidated with that of pldt, before the 12th division. the consolidation effectively extended the benefit of pldt’s tro to globe telecom. the parties were required to submit their respective memoranda, after which, the case shall be deemed submitted for resolution.
on february 17, 2017, the ca issued a resolution denying pcc’s motion for reconsideration dated september 14, 2016 for lack of merit. in the same resolution, the court granted pldt’s urgent motion for the issuance of a gag order and ordered the pcc to remove the offending publication from its website and also to obey the sub judice rule and refrain from making any further public pronouncements regarding the transaction while the case remains pending. the court also reminded the other parties, pldt and globe, to likewise observe the sub judice rule. for this purpose, the court issued its gag order admonishing all the parties “to refrain, cease and desist from issuing public comments and statements that would violate the sub judice rule and subject them to indirect contempt of court. the parties were also required to comment within ten days from receipt of the resolution, on the motion for leave to intervene, and admit the petition-in intervention dated february 7, 2017 filed by citizenwatch, a non-stock and non-profit association.
on april 18, 2017, pcc filed a petition before the supreme court docketed as g.r. no. 230798, to lift the ca's order that has prevented the review of the sale of san miguel corp.'s telecommunications unit to pldt inc. and globe telecom. on april 25, 2017, globe filed before the supreme court a motion for intervention with motion to dismiss the petition filed by the pcc.
as of june 30, 2017, the supreme court did not issue any tro on the pcc's petition to lift the injunction issued by the ca. hence, the pcc remains barred from reviewing the smc deal.
on july 26, 2017, globe received the supreme court's en banc resolution granting globe's extremely urgent motion to intervene. in the same resolution, the supreme court treated as comment, globe's motion to dismiss with opposition ad cautelam to pcc's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or tro.
on august 31, 2017, globe received another resolution of the supreme court en banc, requiring the pcc to file a consolidated reply to the comments respectively filed by globe and pldt, within ten (10) days from notice. globe has yet to receive the consolidated reply of pcc since the latter requested for extension of time to file the same.
in the meantime, in a decision dated october 18, 2017, the court of appeals, in ca-g.r. sp no. 146528 and ca-g.r. sp no. 146538, granted globe and pldts petition to permanently enjoin and prohibiting pcc from reviewing the acquisition and compelling the pcc to recognize the same as deemed approved. pcc elevated the case to the supreme court via petition for review on certiorari.
the globe group is contingently liable for various claims arising in the ordinary conduct of business and certain tax assessments which are either pending decision by the courts or are being contested, the outcome of which are not presently determinable. in the opinion of management and legal counsel, the possibility of outflow of economic resources to settle the contingent liability is remote.
