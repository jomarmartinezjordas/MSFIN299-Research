globe home broadband revenues as of end-december 2019 registered at p21.7 billion, up 17% from the p18.6 billion reported a year ago. this was due to the sustained expansion of its customer base, now rising to over 2.0 million subscribers from 1.6 million last year. the revenue growth and customer uptake was led by home broadband’s compelling data bundles and packages which now includes high- speed internet with the at home air fiber 5g plans, coupled with the growing popularity of the home prepaid wi-fi product.

on a consolidated basis, corporate data business sustained its growth momentum, ending the year with p12.8 billion revenues, or up 9% year-on-year, driven by the sustained circuit base expansion, the strong demand for domestic and international leased line services, cloud-based services, and managed/modern business solutions.

globe’s total fixed line voice revenues however, declined year-on-year by 10%.
both globe and innove offer ild voice services which cover international call services between the philippines to 237 destinations with 776 roaming partners. this service generates revenues from both inbound and outbound international call traffic, with pricing based on agreed international termination rates for inbound traffic revenues and ntc-approved ild rates for outbound traffic revenues.
globe’s ild voice revenues from the mobile and fixed line businesses declined year-on-year by 21% (from p6.7 billion in 2018 to p5.3 billion in 2019). this is attributed to the continued migration of international traffic through other internet-based applications.

globe ended the year with total costs and expenses at p=107.1 billion or 9% higher from p=98.2 billion a year ago, due to increases across many expense line items except for interconnect costs, rent expenses, and provisions. higher expenses for the period was mainly to support all existing network projects in response to the growing business’ demands.

interconnect charges for the year declined by 30% to only nearly p=4.0 billion from the p=5.7 billion in 2018, driven by the decrease in inter-network traffic usages for mobile voice, sms and roaming coupled with impact of the decline in interconnection rates for both sms (₱0.15 to ₱0.05) and voice (from ₱2.50 to ₱0.50) effective september 1, 2018.

marketing and subsidy expenses grew by 23% to reach p=7.4 billion from nearly p=6.0 billion reported a year ago due higher spending for ads & promos coupled with higher commissions.

staff costs were up 17% to p=15.5 billion in 2019 from p=13.3 billion in 2018 due to the 4% increase in headcount (8,048 in 2019 vs. 7,729 in 2018), translating to higher salaries and employee-related benefits and incentives.

utilities, supplies, and other administrative expenses, which contribute 9% of total operating expenses and subsidy, also reported an increase of 10%, totaling to p=6.6 billion from close to p=6.0 billion reported in 2018. the increase was mainly driven by utilities, on electricity’s higher average rate and consumption.

rent expenses for the year 2019 was at p=5.8 billion, down by 11% from a year ago. this accounts for 8% of total operating expenses and subsidy. lower lease expenses were attributed to the adoption of pfrs 161 effective january 2019, which changed accounting of operating leases from outright profit and loss recognition to capitalized assets.

repairs and maintenance costs for the year stood at p=8.5 billion, up by 7% from the p=7.9 billion reported a year ago. this was largely on higher expenditures for hardware/software and subscriber lines, higher maintenance costs for communication equipment, as well as corrective and preventive outside plant repairs costs. repairs and maintenance accounted for 12% of total operating expenses and subsidy.

this account includes provisions related to trade, non-trade and traffic receivables and inventory. overall, provisions account for 6% of total operating expenses and subsidy. total provisions for the year declined to only p=4.4 billion, or 4% decline from the p=4.6 billion reported in 2018 due lower other provisions. elevated level of provisions in 2018 was mainly attributed to the additional real property tax provisions (ie. nasugbu-pacnet, msc aurora and leyte) booked in september of last year.

accounting for 29% of total operating expenses and subsidy, services and expenses grew by 17% from p= 17.8 billion reported in 2018 driven mostly by higher managed services, cloud services, professional/advisory fees and subscriber line services.

depreciation and amortization expenses for the year rose to p=34.1 billion from p=30.4 billion reported in 2018, given globe’s sustained higher capital investments and impact of ifrs 16 adjustments.

the globe group’s full year 2019 non-operating charges, increased by 28% from the p=7.1 billion reported last year to p=9.1 billion this period. this was attributed to higher share in affiliates’ losses particularly from mynt, coupled with higher interest expenses, loss associated with yondu reacquisition and increase in swap costs.

globe’s balance sheet and cash flows remain strong with ample liquidity and gearing comfortably within bank covenants.
globe group’s consolidated assets as of 31 december 2019 amounted to p304.3 billion compared to p299.5 billion as of december 31, 2018. consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short term investments (including investments in assets available for sale and held to maturity investments) was at p8.3 billion as of end-december of 2019 compared to p23.2 billion as of end-december 2018.
globe closed 2019 with gross debt to equity ratio on a consolidated basis at 1.68:1 and is still within the 3.0:1 debt to equity limit dictated by globe’s debt covenants. meanwhile, net debt to equity ratio was at 1.58:1 as of end-december 2019 and 1.71:1 as of end december 2018. globe’s current ratio stood at 0.73:1 as of 31 december 2019 and 0.86:1 as of 31 december 2018 which are at par with industry standards. while globe’s average current ratio was below the sec’s minimum of 1:1, globe believes it has more than sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its debt maturities, currently and prospectively.
the financial tests under globe’s loan agreements include compliance with the following ratios:
total debt* to equity not exceeding 3.0:1;
total debt to ebitda not exceeding 3.5:1;
total debt service coverage1 exceeding 1.3 times; and
secured debt ratio2 not exceeding 0.2 times.
*composed of notes payable, current portion long term debt, long term debt and net derivative liabilities
as of 31 december 2019, globe is well within the ratios prescribed under its loan agreements.

net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2019 was at p74.0 billion, up 28% from the previous year.
meanwhile, net cash used in investing activities amounting to p55.0 billion, was 29% higher from last year. consolidated cash capital expenditures as of end-december 2019 amounted to p=51.0 billion, or 18% higher from last year’s p=43.3 billion.

consolidated net cash from financing activities amounted to p33.3 billion, significantly higher than last year’s p3.4 billion driven by higher repayment of borrowings, and interest payments, coupled with the lease liability payments this period with the adoption of pfrs 16. consolidated total debt, on the other hand declined by 8% from p=148.3 billion at the end of december 2018 to only p=136.3 billion at the end of december this year.
90% of us$ consolidated loans have been effectively converted to php via us$396 million in currency hedges. after swaps, effectively 2% of total debt is denominated in us$.

the globe group has available uncommitted short-term credit facilities of usd 94 million and ₱16,350 million as of december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018.

the dividend policy of globe telecom as approved by the board of directors is to declare cash dividends to its common stockholders on a regular basis as may be determined by the board. the dividend payout rate is reviewed annually and subsequently each quarter of the year, taking into account globe telecom’s operating results, cash flows, debt covenants, capital expenditure levels and liquidity.
on november 8, 2011, the board of directors approved the current dividend policy of globe telecom to distribute cash dividend at the rate of 75% to 90% of prior year’s core net income.
on august 6, 2013, the board of directors further approved the change in distribution from semi-annual dividend payments to quarterly dividend distributions. on december 10, 2013, the bod approved to defer the implementation of the quarterly dividend payout to the third quarter of 2014.
on november 5, 2018, the board of directors likewise approved the proposed change in the dividend policy from 75% to 90% of prior year’s core net income to 60% to 75% of prior year’s core net income, to be applied to the 2019 dividend declaration. the amended policy will provide globe with increased flexibility with respect to capital management. this adjustment will also ensure the sustainability of the operations in this investment-heavy environment, while protecting future dividends, once planned expansion yields beneficial results.
the board of directors of globe approved in separate approvals the declaration of four quarterly distributions of cash dividends of p22.75 per share, paid each last march 13, 2019, may 31, 2019, august 30, 2019 and december 6, 2019. each cash dividend payment total to about p3.0 billion, bringing total distribution by end of december 2019 to p12.0 billion.
likewise, the board of directors of globe approved in separate approvals the declaration of the two semi-annual cash dividends for holders of its non-voting preferred shares paid each last february 22 and august 22, 2019. the amount of the cash dividend was at a fixed rate of 5.2006% per annum calculated in respect of each share by reference to the offer price of p500.00 per share on a 30/360-day basis for the six-month dividend period.
on december 10, 2019, the board of directors of globe approved the declaration of the cash dividend for holders of its voting preferred shares payable on december 27, 2019 to shareholders on record as of december 26, 2019. the amount of the cash dividend will be based on the 3-day average of the 5yr bval preceding the dividend rate setting date (i.e. average of october 24, 25, 28, 2019) plus 2%. the aggregate dividend payment for the voting preferred shares is about p50.0 million. on the same date, the globe bod also approved the declaration and payment of the first semi-annual 2020 cash dividends for the company’s non-voting preferred shareholders on record as of january 29, 2020. the amount of the cash dividend was at a fixed rate of 5.2006% per annum calculated in respect of each share by reference to the offer price of p500.00 per share on a 30/360-day basis for the six-month dividend period. payment date: february 22, 2020.

consolidated return on average equity (roe) registered at 28.9% as of end-december 2019, compared to 26.7% in 2018 using annualized net income and based on average equity balances for the year ended. using annualized core net income, which excludes the effects of non-recurring expenses on net income, return on average equity as of end-december 2019 and 2018 were 29.1% and 26.8%, respectively.

accordingly, consolidated basic earnings per common share were p162.96 and p135.91, while consolidated diluted earnings per common share were p162.20 and p135.40 as of end-december 2019 and 2018, respectively.

foreign exchange risks are managed such that usd inflows from operations (transaction exposures) are balanced or offset by the net usd liability position of the company (translation exposures). globe group’s objective is to maintain a position which results in, as close as possible, a neutral effect to the p&l relative to movements in the foreign exchange market.
globe has natural net us$ inflows arising from its operations. consolidated foreign currency-linked revenues1 were at 8% and 10% of total gross service revenues for the periods ended 31 december 2019 and 2018, respectively. in contrast, globe’s foreign-currency linked expenses were at 12% and 13% of total operating expenses for the same periods ended.
due to these net us$ inflows, an appreciation of the peso has a negative impact on globe’s peso ebitda. globe occasionally enters into forward contracts to hedge against a peso appreciation.
there were no outstanding forward usd sale contracts as of december 31, 2019.

globe’s foreign exchange translation exposures result primarily from movements of the philippine peso (php) against the u.s. dollars (usd) with respect to usd-denominated financial assets, usd- denominated financial liabilities and certain usd-denominated revenues. majority of revenues are generated in php, while bulk of capital expenditures are in usd. in addition, 16% of debt as of december 31, 2019 are denominated in usd before taking into account any swap and hedges. after swaps, effectively 2% of total debt is denominated in us$.

as of end-december 2019, the globe group posted a total of ₱848 million net foreign exchange gain.
the globe group‘s foreign exchange risk management policy is to maintain a hedged financial position, after taking into account expected usd flows from operations and financing transactions. globe telecom enters into short-term foreign currency forwards and long-term foreign currency swap contracts in order to achieve this target.
as of end-december 2019, globe has us$298 million in cross currency swap contracts which are hedges of the interest and foreign exchange risks of some of our us$ loans maturing in april 2020, december 2023, august 2024, march 2025, and august 2027. the mtm of the outstanding swap contracts stood at a loss of ₱474 million as of end-december 2019.
as of end-december 2019, globe has us$97.7 million in principal only swap contracts which are hedges of the foreign exchange risks of some of our us$ loans maturing in april 2020, april 2022 and october 2022. the mtm of the swap contracts stood at a gain of ₱165 million as of end-december 2019.
globe has us$82 million short-term fx swap contracts which remain outstanding as of end-december 2019. the mark-to-market of the outstanding fx swap contracts stood at a loss of us$12 million as of end-december 2019.
globe has us$30 million in outstanding forward usd purchase contracts which remain outstanding as of end-december 2019. the mark-to-market of the outstanding forward usd purchase contracts stood at a loss of us$58 million as of end-december 2019.

interest rate exposures are managed via targeted levels of fixed versus floating rate debt that are meant to achieve a balance between cost and volatility. globe’s policy is to maintain between 44-88% of its peso debt in fixed rate, and between 31-62% of its us$ debt in fixed rate.
as of end-december 2019, globe has a total of us$77.7 million in us$ interest swaps and us$298 million in cross currency swaps that were entered in to contracts to achieve these targets. the us$ swaps fixed some of the company’s outstanding floating rate debts with semi-annual payment intervals up to april 2020, and quarterly payment intervals up to april 2022, october 2022, december 2023, august 2024, march 2025, and august 2027.
as of end-december 2019, 85% (excluding short-term debt) of peso debt is fixed, while 57% of usd debt is fixed after swaps.
the mtm of the interest rate swap contracts (not including the currency swap contracts) stood at a loss of ₱32 million as of end-december 2019.

outstanding credit exposures from financial instruments are monitored daily and allowable exposures are reviewed quarterly.
for investments, the globe group does not have investments in foreign securities (bonds, collateralized debt obligations (cdo), collateralized mortgage obligations (cmo), or any instruments linked to the mortgage market in the us). globe’s excess cash is invested in short term bank deposits.
the globe group also does not have any investments or hedging transactions with investment banks. derivative transactions as of the end of the period are with large foreign and local banks. furthermore, the globe group does not have instruments in its portfolio which became inactive in the market nor does the company have any structured notes which require use of judgment for valuation purposes.

the company uses valuation techniques that are commonly used by market participants and that have been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions. the company uses readily observable market yield curves to discount future receipts and payments on the transactions. the net present value of receipts and payments are translated into peso using the foreign exchange rate at time of valuation to arrive at the mark to market value. for derivative instruments with optionality, the company relies on valuation reports of its counterparty banks, which are the company’s best estimates of the close-out value of the transactions.
gains (losses) on derivative instruments represent the net mark-to-market (mtm) gains (losses) on derivative instruments. as of december 31, 2019, the mtm value of the derivatives of the globe group amounted to ₱411.36 million while net loss on derivative instruments arising from changes in mtm reflected in the consolidated income statements as of end-december 2019 amounted to ₱809.54 million.
to measure riskiness, the company provides a sensitivity analysis of its profit and loss from financial instruments resulting from movements in foreign exchange and interest rates. the interest rate sensitivity estimates the changes to the following p&l items, given an indicated movement in interest rates: (1) interest income, (2) interest expense, (3) mark-to-market of derivative instruments. the foreign exchange sensitivity estimates the p&l impact of a change in the usd/php rate as it specifically pertains to the revaluation of the net unhedged liability position of the company, and foreign exchange derivatives.

the globe group is contingently liable for various claims arising in the ordinary conduct of business and certain tax assessments which are either pending decision by the courts or are being contensted, the outcome of which are not presently determinable. in the opinion of management and legal counsel, the possibility of outflow of economic resources to settle the contingent liability is remote.

on october 10, 2011, the ntc issued memorandum circular (mc) no. 02-10-2011 titled interconnection charge for short messaging service requiring all public telecommunication entities to reduce their interconnection charge to each other from ₱0.35 to ₱0.15 per text, which globe telecom complied as early as november 2011. on december 11, 2011, the ntc one stop public assistance center (ospac) filed a complaint against globe telecom, smart and digitel alleging violation of the said mc no. 02-10-2011 and asking for the reduction of sms off-net retail price from ₱1.00 to ₱0.80 per text. globe telecom filed its response maintaining the position that the reduction of the sms interconnection charges does not automatically translate to a reduction in the sms retail charge per text.
on november 20, 2012, the ntc rendered a decision directing globe telecom to:
reduce its regular sms retail rate from p1.00 to not more than ₱0.80;
refund/reimburse its subscribers the excess charge of ₱0.20; and
pay a fine of ₱200.00 per day from december1,2011 until date of compliance.
on may 7, 2014, ntc denied the motion for reconsideration (mr) filed by globe telecom last december 5, 2012 in relation to the november 20, 2012 decision. globe telecom’s assessment is that globe telecom is in compliance with the ntc memorandum circular no. 02-10-2011. on june 9, 2014, globe telecom filed petition for review of the ntc decision and resolution with the court of appeals (ca).
the ca granted the petition in a resolution dated september 3, 2014 by issuing a 60-day temporary restraining order on the implementation of memorandum circular 02-10-2011 by the ntc. on october 15, 2014, globe telecom posted a surety bond to compensate for possible damages as directed by the ca.
on june 27, 2016, the ca rendered a decision reversing the ntc’s abovementioned decision and resolution requiring telecommunications companies to cut their sms rates and return the excess amount paid by subscribers. the ca said that the ntc order was baseless as there is no showing that the reduction in the sms rate is mandated under mc no. 02-10-2011; there is no showing, either that the present p1.00 per text rate is unreasonable and unjust, as this was not mandated under the memorandum. moreover, under the ntc’s own mc no. 02-05-2008, sms is a value added service (vas) whose rates are deregulated. the respective motions for reconsideration filed by ntc and that of intervenor bayan muna party list (bayan muna) representatives neri javier colmenares and carlos isagani zarate were both denied.
the ntc thus elevated the ca’s ruling to the supreme court (sc) via a petition for review on certiorari dated september 15, 2017.
for its part, bayan muna filed its own petition for review on certiorari of the ca’s decision. on january 4, 2018, globe received a copy of the sc’s resolution dated november 6, 2017, requiring it to comment on said petition of bayan muna. subsequently, on february 21, 2018, globe received a copy of the sc’s resolution dated december 13, 2017 consolidating the petitions for review filed by bayan muna and ntc, and requiring globe to file its comment on the petition for review filed by ntc. thus, on april 2, 2018, globe filed its consolidated comment on both bayan muna and the ntc’s petitions for review. on september 18, 2018, globe received a copy of bayan muna’s consolidated reply to globe’s consolidated comment and digitel and smart’s comment.
globe telecom believes that it did not violate ntc mc no. 02-10-2011 when it did not reduce its sms retail rate from php 1.00 to php 0.80 per text, and hence, would not be obligated to refund its subscribers. however, if it is ultimately decided by the supreme court (in case an appeal is taken thereto by the ntc from the adverse resolution of the ca) that globe telecom is not compliant with said circular, globe may be contingently liable to refund to its subscribers the ₱0.20 difference (between ₱1.00 and ₱0.80 per text) reckoned from november 20, 2012 until said decision by the sc becomes final and executory. management does not have an estimate of the potential claims currently.

on july 23, 2009, the ntc issued ntc mc no. 05-07-2009 (guidelines on unit of billing of mobile voice service). the mc provides that the maximum unit of billing for the cellular mobile telephone system (cmts) whether postpaid or prepaid shall be six (6) seconds per pulse. the rate for the first two (2) pulses, or equivalent if lower period per pulse is used, may be higher than the succeeding pulses to recover the cost of the call set-up. subscribers may still opt to be billed on a one (1) minute per pulse basis or to subscribe to unlimited service offerings or any service offerings if they actively and knowingly enroll in the scheme.
on december 28, 2010, the court of appeals (ca) rendered its decision declaring null and void and reversing the decisions of the ntc in the rates applications cases for having been issued in violation of globe telecom and the other carriers’ constitutional and statutory right to due process. however, while the decision is in globe telecom’s favor, there is a provision in the decision that ntc did not violate the right of petitioners to due process when it declared via circular that the per pulse billing scheme shall be the default.
on january 21, 2011, globe telecom and two other telecom carriers, filed their respective motions for partial reconsideration (mr) on the pronouncement that “the per pulse billing scheme shall be the default”. the petitioners and the ntc filed their respective motion for reconsideration, which were all denied by the ca on january 19, 2012.
on march 12, 2012, globe and innove elevated to the supreme court the questioned portions of the decision and resolution of the ca dated december 28, 2010 and its resolution dated january 19, 2012. the other service providers, as well as the ntc, filed their own petitions for review. the adverse parties have filed their comments on each other’s petitions, as well as their replies to each other’s comments. parties were required to file their respective memoranda and globe filed its memorandum on may 25, 2018. the case is now submitted for resolution.

pldt and its affiliate, bonifacio communications corporation (bcc) and innove and globe telecom are in litigation over the right of innove to render services and build telecommunications infrastructure in the bonifacio global city (bgc). in the case filed by innove before the ntc against bcc, pldt and the fort bonifacio development corporation (fbdc), the ntc has issued a cease and desist order preventing bcc from performing further acts to interfere with innove’s installations in the bgc.
on january 21, 2011, bcc and pldt filed with the ca a petition for certiorari and prohibition against the ntc, et al. seeking to annul the order of the ntc dated october 28, 2008 directing bcc, pldt and fbdc to comply with the provisions of ntc mc 05-05-02 and to cease and desist from performing further acts that will prevent innove from implementing and providing telecommunications services in the fort bonifacio global city pursuant to the authorization granted by the ntc. on april 25, 2011, innove communications, filed its comment on the petition.
on august 16, 2011, the ca ruled that the petition against innove and the ntc lacked merit, holding that neither bcc nor pldt could claim the exclusive right to install telecommunications infrastructure and providing telecommunications services within the bgc. thus, the ca denied the petition and dismissed the case. pldt and bcc filed their motions for reconsideration thereto, which the ca denied.
on july 6, 2012, pldt and bcc assailed the ca’s rulings via a petition for review on certiorari with the supreme court. innove and globe filed their comment on said petition on january 14, 2013, to which said petitioners filed their reply on may 21, 2013. the case remains pending with the sc.
in a case filed by bcc against fbdc, globe telecom, and innove before the rtc of pasig, which case sought to enjoin innove from making any further installations in the bgc and claimed damages from all the parties for the breach of the exclusivity of bcc in the area, the court did not issue a tro and has instead scheduled several hearings on the case. the defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of forum shopping and lack of jurisdiction, among others. on march 30, 2012, the rtc of pasig, as prayed for, dismissed the complaint on the aforesaid grounds. the motion for reconsideration filed by bcc on july 20, 2012 remains pending with the trial court.

in a letter dated june 7, 2016 issued by philippine competition commission (pcc) to globe telecom, pldt, smc and vti regarding the joint notice filed by the aforementioned parties on may 30, 2016, disclosing the acquisition by globe telecom and pldt of the entire issued and outstanding shares of vti, the pcc claims that the notice was deficient in form and substance and concludes that the acquisition cannot be claimed to be deemed approved.
on june 10, 2016, globe telecom formally responded to the letter reiterating that the notice, which sets forth the salient terms and conditions of the transaction, was filed pursuant to and in accordance with memorandum circular no. l6-002 (mc no. l6-002) issued by the pcc. mc no. 16-002 provides that before the implementing rules and regulations for republic act no. 10667 (the philippine competition act of 2015) come into full force and effect, upon filing with the pcc of a notice in which the salient terms and conditions of an acquisition are set forth, the transaction is deemed approved by the pcc and as such, it may no longer be challenged. further, globe telecom clarified in its letter that the supposed deficiency in form and substance of the notice is not a ground to prevent the transaction from being deemed approved. the only exception to the rule that a transaction is deemed approved is when a notice contains false material information. in this regard, globe telecom stated that the notice does not contain any false information.
on june 17, 2016, globe telecom received a copy of the second letter issued by pcc stating that notwithstanding the position of globe telecom, it was ruling that the transaction was still subject for review.
on july 12, 2016, globe telecom asked the ca to stop the government's anti-trust body from reviewing the acquisition of smc's telecommunications business. globe telecom maintains the position that the deal was approved after globe telecom notified the pcc of the transaction and that the anti-trust body violated its own rules by insisting on a review. on the same day, globe telecom filed a petition for mandamus, certiorari and prohibition against the pcc, docketed as ca-g.r. sp no. 146538. on july 25, 2016, the ca, through its 6th division issued a resolution denying globe telecom’s application for tro and injunction against pcc’s review of the transaction. in the same resolution, however, the ca required the pcc to comment on globe telecom's petition for certiorari and mandamus within 10 days from receipt thereof. the pcc filed said comment on august 8, 2016. in said comment, the pcc prayed that the ₱70 billion deal between pldt- globe telecom and san miguel be declared void for pldt and globe telecom’s alleged failure to comply with the requirements of the philippine competition act of 2015. the pcc also prayed that the ca direct globe telecom to: cease and desist from further implementing its co-acquisition of the san miguel telecommunications assets; undo all acts consummated pursuant to said acquisition; and pay the appropriate administrative penalties that may be imposed by the pcc under the philippine competition act for the illegal consummation of the subject acquisition. the case remains pending with the ca.
meanwhile, pldt filed a similar petition with the ca, docketed as ca g.r. sp no. 146528, which was raffled off to its 12th division. on august 26, 2016, pldt secured a tro from said court. thereafter, globe telecom’s petition was consolidated with that of pldt, before the 12th division. the consolidation effectively extended the benefit of pldt’s tro to globe telecom. the parties were required to submit their respective memoranda, after which, the case shall be deemed submitted for resolution.
on february 17, 2017, the ca issued a resolution denying pcc’s motion for reconsideration dated september 14, 2016 for lack of merit. in the same resolution, the court granted pldt’s urgent motion for the issuance of a gag order and ordered the pcc to remove the offending publication from its website and also to obey the sub judice rule and refrain from making any further public pronouncements regarding the transaction while the case remains pending. the court also reminded the other parties, pldt and globe, to likewise observe the sub judice rule. for this purpose, the court issued its gag order admonishing all the parties “to refrain, cease and desist from issuing public comments and statements that would violate the sub judice rule and subject them to indirect contempt of court. the parties were also required to comment within ten days from receipt of the resolution, on the motion for leave to intervene, and admit the petition-in intervention dated february 7, 2017 filed by citizenwatch, a non-stock and non-profit association.
on april 18, 2017, pcc filed a petition before the sc docketed as g.r. no. 230798, to lift the ca's order that has prevented the review of the sale of san miguel corp.'s telecommunications unit to pldt inc. and globe telecom. on april 25, 2017, globe filed before the sc a motion for intervention with motion to dismiss the petition filed by the pcc.
as of june 30, 2017, the sc did not issue any tro on the pcc's petition to lift the injunction issued by the ca. hence, the pcc remains barred from reviewing the smc deal.
on july 26, 2017, globe received the sc en banc resolution granting globe's extremely urgent motion to intervene. in the same resolution, the supreme court treated as comment, globe's motion to dismiss with opposition ad cautelam to pcc's application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or tro.
on august 31, 2017, globe received another resolution of the sc en banc, requiring the pcc to file a consolidated reply to the comments respectively filed by globe and pldt, within ten (10) days from notice. globe has yet to receive the consolidated reply of pcc since the latter requested for extension of time to file the same.
in the meantime, in a decision dated october 18, 2017, the ca, in ca-g.r. sp no. 146528 and ca-g.r. sp no. 146538, granted globe and pldts petition to permanently enjoin and prohibiting pcc from reviewing the acquisition and compelling the pcc to recognize the same as deemed approved. pcc elevated the case to the sc via petition for review on certiorari.
