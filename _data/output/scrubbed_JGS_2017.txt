consolidated revenues grew 13.7% from p=240.50 billion in 2016 to p=273.45 billion in 2017 due to the performance of the following core subsidiaries:
∂ urc’s total revenues increased by 11.0% from p=112.61 billion in 2016 to p=125.01 billion in 2017 driven by the 30.1% increase in bcfg international sales and 33.6% sales growth of the sugar business.

revenues from our core investments, however, declined this year as dividend income received by the group dropped 28.5% from p=2.03 billion last year to p=1.45 billion this year mainly due to lower dividend income declared by pldt from p=106 per share in 2016 to p=76 per share in 2017. equity in net earnings of associates, primarily from our investments in uic/singapore land and meralco, increased by 21.2% from p=8.18 billion in 2016 to p=9.91 billion in 2017, including the p=719.18 billion full-year equity earnings take-up from gbpc in 2017.

market valuation loss on impaired available-for-sale investments recorded in 2016 pertains to the impairment loss recognized due to the significant drop in the market price of pldt shares from an average acquisition cost of p=2,331 per share to p=1,365 per share as of end of 2016. as of end of 2017, pldt’s share price was p=1,480, with the increase during the year recognized directly in equity under ‘net unrealized gains on afs investments’.
