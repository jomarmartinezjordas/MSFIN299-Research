the group recognized a net foreign exchange loss of p=3.1 billion in 2021 from p=2.6 billion foreign exchange gain in 2020 driven by the depreciation of philippine peso vs u.s. dollar in respect to our dollar-denominated long-term debt and convertible bonds payable.

air transportation generated revenues amounting to p=15.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, 30.4% lower than the p=22.6 billion revenues earned in the same period last year mainly driven by the decrease in passenger revenue by p=6.3 billion or 50.2% to p=6.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021 from p=12.6 billion generated in 2020. this was largely due to the 32.1% decline in passenger volume from 5.0 million to 3.4 million in line with lesser number of flights by 17.6% coupled with a 15.3 ppts decrease in seat load factor from 75.9% to 60.6%. lower average fares by 26.7% to p=1,843 for the year ended december 31, 2021 from p=2,513 for the same period last year also contributed to lower revenues. cargo operations continued to supplement the business as revenues grew by p=1.1 billion or 19.8% to p=6.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021 from p=5.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020 mostly due to increase in kilograms carried by about 10.4% and higher yield by 8.5%. ancillary revenues decreased by p=1.6 billion or 35.0% to p=3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021 from p=4.6 billion recorded in the same period last year mainly attributable to lesser passenger volume and flight activity during the period.
ceb incurred operating expenses of p=38.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, lower by 10.3% compared to the p=43.4 billion operating expenses incurred for year ended december 31, 2020. this was primarily brought about by the ceb’s reduced operations due to the covid-19 global pandemic since a material portion of its expenses are based on flights and flight hours. the slight strengthening of the philippine peso against the u.s. dollar as referenced by the appreciation of the philippine peso to an average of p49.27 per u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2021 from an average of p=49.61 per u.s. dollar during the same period last year based on the philippine bloomberg valuation (ph bval) weighted average rates also contributed to the drop in operating expenses.

interest income decreased by p=121 million or 76.9% to p=36 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 from p=158 million earned in the same period last year largely due to lesser cash balance particularly in the early months of 2021 and lower average interest rates on usd short term placements.

interest expense increased by p=301 million or 17.5% to p=2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021 from p=1.7 billion for the same period last year due to the accrual of interest on convertible bonds issued last may 2021 and promissory notes availed in the latter part of 2020 and early 2021. this was offset by the sale and leaseback of five (5) a320 aircraft in the latter part of 2020 and the effect of the slight appreciation of the philippine peso against the u.s. dollar.
on november 3, 2020, ceb signed a deed of absolute sale of its 35% shareholding in sia engineering (philippines) corporation (siaep) to siaec which resulted to a gain on disposal of p=34.5 million. as of december 31, 2020, ceb no longer has any equity interest in siaep. on the same date, ceb acquired siaec’s 51% interest in a-plus, making the latter a wholly- subsidiary of ceb. the recognition of the investment in a-plus as a subsidiary resulted to a gain on remeasurement of p=71.3 million on ceb’s existing 49% shareholding.

petrochemicals (consist of jgspc, jgsoc and peak fuel) combined gross revenues reached p=40.3 billion in 2021, almost double of last year’s p=21.3 billion, driven by strong volumes and higher average selling prices (asp) due to strong demand recovery from the global economic slowdown in 2020 caused by the covid-19 pandemic, as well as the extended facility shutdown of jgsoc until 1q 2020 for turnaround maintenance and project tie-ins. 2021 revenues also include the fresh contributions from its lpg trading business and the newly commissioned aromatics extraction unit. ebitda expanded 463% to p=3.1 billion on the back of strong volumes, which offset higher naphtha prices. moreover, utilization rates improved considering the planned shutdowns in 1q20. full year cracker and polymer rates were at 91% and 83%, up from 70% and 69%, respectively.
interest expense increased from p=369 million in 2020 to p=805 million in 2021 due higher level of trust receipts and short-term notes payable which were obtained to finance its working capital requirements and expansion projects. a net foreign exchange loss of p=404 million was also recognized in 2021 from last year’s net foreign exchange gain of p=396 million. all these factors contributed to the net loss of p=2.1 billion in 2021 from last year’s p=2.0 billion
banking services generated banking revenue of p=9.3 billion in 2021 which remained stable from last year’s p=9.2 billion. this was driven by higher loans, which grew 14% yoy versus the industry’s 5%, and higher commission income, offset by lower trading gains. this loan expansion, coupled with stable net interest margins and a better cost-to-income ratio led to strong profit growth at 33% yoy, bringing net income to p=1.2 billion. despite faster loan expansion, rbank's npl ratio of 3.3% as of end-2021 remained lower than the industry average of 4.0%.
equity in net earnings of associated companies and joint ventures amounted to p=9.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, a 27.7% increase from last year’s p=7.6 billion driven primarily by higher equity in net earnings of meralco from p=4.6 billion in 2020 to p=6.7 billion in 2021 given the growth in energy consumption across residential, commercial, and industrial segments. the absence of last year’s impairment charge on its pacific light power investment also boosted income.
for singapore land group, equity in net earnings increased to p=2.7 billion, from p=2.5 billion last year. the recognition of income from its residential joint venture tempered the negative impact of the pandemic on its property trading & technology operations segments.

receivables, including noncurrent portion increased by 9.2% from p=135.2 billion as of december 31, 2020 to p=147.7 billion as of december 31, 2021 mainly due to the increase in finance receivables of the banking business.
