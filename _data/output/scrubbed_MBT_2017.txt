metrobank’s medium term plan remains focused on sustaining and increasing market relevance through continuous improvement in customer experience, operational efficiency and people development.
the bank is currently working on its customer experience (cex) strategy, having empowered a service excellence group that is governed by a committee to pursue investments and enhancements in customer touchpoints (face-to-face, branches and e-channels, documents), and more importantly, define customer satisfaction standards and spearhead customer complaints resolution.
the creation of a premium cex proposition is backed by an ongoing service culture transformation program that is based primarily on external customer expectations.
in this light, process and it capabilities - particularly its digital platform - and people resources are being prepared to ensure the delivery of the envisioned cex promise. investments in analytics, automation, product and channel development, and skill and mindset programs have been made to allow people and technology to work together.

the bank will continue to actively improve on the group's strong capital position. the bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise tier 1 and tier 2 capital. the bank also concluded a series of measures to prepare for basel iii implementation.
in 2006, the bank issued us$125.0 million hybrid tier 1 capital security in february and 173,618,400 common shares at p38.00 per common share in october. in may 2010, the bank raised an additional p5.0 billion in capital through a private placement of common shares. in january 2011, the bank raised approximately us$220.0 million through a rights offer for 200 million common shares at the offer price of p50.00 per rights share. in august 2013, the bank increased its capital stock from p50 billion to p100 billion and on september 16, 2013, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 633,415,805 common shares (with a par value of p20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock, which further improved the bank’s capital position. in april 2015, the bank raised approximately p32.0 billion through a rights offer for 435,371,720 common shares with par value of p20.00 priced at p73.50 per share. the newly issued shares were listed on the pse on april 7, 2015.
the bank also issued tier 2 instruments to boost its capital adequacy ratio. the bank issued basel ii compliant tier 2 subordinated notes in october 2007 for p8.5 billion with a coupon of 7.0%; in october 2008 for p5.5 billion with a coupon of 7.75%; and in may 2009 for p4.5 billion with a coupon of 7.5%. with the advent of basel iii, the bank subsequently redeemed these previously issued subordinated debt issuances as they would not have been considered as capital beginning january 1, 2014. the bank exercised the call option on its p8.5 billion 7.0%; p5.5 billion 7.75% and p4.5 billion 7.5% lower tier 2 notes on october 22, 2012, october 4, 2013 and may 6, 2014, respectively. the early redemptions of these instruments were in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes when they were originally issued. by redeeming the notes, the bank avoided a step-up in the interest rate and the capital decay from the instruments. in 2014, the bank raised a total of p22.5 billion in subordinated debt wherein p16.0 billion was issued on march 27, 2014 at a coupon rate of 5.375% and p6.5 billion on august 8, 2014 at 5.25%. the terms of the notes contain a loss absorption feature, allowing them to be recognized as bank capital in accordance with basel iii standards. the transactions were done in part to replace the basel ii tier 2 notes which were redeemed on their call option dates.
basel iii penalizes banks for their holdings in non-allied undertakings. as such, during the period 2012-2016, the group has actively sought to divest itself of such undertakings and strengthen its standing under basel iii. these transactions included the sale of the bank’s ownership in tmpc in tranches between 2012 and 2013 as well as the sale of fmic’s holdings in gbpc in tranches between 2013 and 2016 and fmic’s holdings in charter ping an insurance corporation in 2014. in 2014, the bank and psbank also disposed of its holdings in tfspc. altogether, these sales further improved the bank’s car position under basel iii. the group continues to review its holdings in non-allied undertakings and may consider selling additional stakes as necessary.

the philippine economy capped 2017 with another solid finish of 6.7% from 6.9% in 2016. for 2017, the philippines is still the fastest economy in the asean region and is just behind china, which posted a full-year growth of 6.9%. the still strong expansion for the year could be mainly attributed to recovery of the exports sector, sustained government expenditures, vibrant industry sector, and rebound of the agri sector.
the bsp kept policy rates steady as inflation throughout the year as inflation remained manageable to average at 3.2%. domestic consumer prices slowly inched up amid base effects and volatile global crude oil prices. global oil prices jumped amid the agreements by oil producers to reduce output and the improving outlook for some of the major advanced economies. broad-based economic recovery is expected to underpin higher global commodity prices amid the strengthening demand and tightening supply.
interest rates are on a slow rise amid the upside pressure on inflation and anticipation for subsequent us fed rate hikes. the us federal reserve raised the federal funds rate three times in 2017 on the back of an improving economy and labor market.
the psei also capped the year on a high note, gaining a total of 25.1% for the year, on investor optimism over the government’s infra spending, tax reform package, and the generally favorable global financial market. the local stock exchange came in at 8,558.42, its best finish for the year, during the last trading session of 2017.
the philippine peso see-sawed between the levels of p49 to p52 from january until mid-november, but ended the year just slightly lower than the start of the year close. the surprise end of the year close of p49.93 was a strong finish for the peso amid positive investor sentiment on the passing of the first package of the tax reform program, seasonal surge of ofw remittances, and strong portfolio inflows.
economic momentum is largely holding up in the world’s largest economies, the effects of which are reverberating across the globe. the global economy is benefiting from a combination of loose financial conditions, more supportive fiscal policies in some key countries following years of harsh fiscal consolidation, low inflation and strong global trade.
the growth in 2017 shows that the philippine economy is on a solid footing and could likely be poised to achieve even faster expansion in 2018. growth is expected to be supported by a pickup in household spending, sustained growth in government spending, robust industry and services sectors, and continued strong expansion of the export sector. expected revenues from the government’s tax reform for acceleration and inclusion (train) law would ensure that the government has enough spending power for the build build build program and could likely translate to sustained higher gdp growth in the coming years. however, risks to the domestic economy remain amid the effects of the still diverse global economic growth and impact of financial market volatilities.

to ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. based on this system of monitoring, the bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. as of december 31, 2017, the contractual maturity profile shows that the bank has at its disposal about p866.03 billion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. this will cover 67.41% of the p1.29 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. these cash inflows exclude afs investments with maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 87.34% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. on the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

in the normal course of the group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. no material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.

for the year 2018, the bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about p3.0 to p5.0 billion, of which 60% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.
