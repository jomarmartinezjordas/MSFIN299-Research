the bank will continue to actively improve on the group's strong capital position. the bank has benefited from a series of capital markets transactions to raise tier 1 and tier 2 capital.
in 2006, the bank issued us$125.0 million hybrid tier 1 capital security in february and 173,618,400 common shares at p38.00 per common share in october. in may 2010, the bank raised an additional p5.0 billion in capital through a private placement of common shares. in january 2011, the bank raised approximately us$220.0 million through a rights offer for 200 million common shares at the offer price of p50.00 per rights share. in august 2013, the bank increased its capital stock from p50 billion to p100 billion and on september 16, 2013, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 633,415,049 common shares (with a par value of p20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock. in april 2015, the bank raised p32.0 billion through a rights offer for 435,371,720 common shares with par value of p20.00 priced at p73.50 per share. the newly issued shares were listed on the pse on april 7, 2015. further, in april 2018, the bank raised p60.0 billion through a rights offer for 799,842,250 common shares with par value of p20.00 priced at p75.00 per share. the newly issued shares were listed on the pse on april 12, 2018. in october 2019, the bank increased its capital stock from p100 billion to p140 billion and on november 26, 2019, it issued a stock dividend equivalent to 517,400,519 common shares (with a par value of p20) that was applied as payment of the required subscription to the increase in capital stock, which further improved the bank’s capital position.
the bank also issued tier 2 instruments to boost its capital adequacy ratio. the bank issued basel ii compliant tier 2 subordinated notes in october 2007 for p8.5 billion with a coupon of 7.0%; in october 2008 for p5.5 billion with a coupon of 7.75%; and in may 2009 for p4.5 billion with a coupon of 7.5%. with the advent of basel iii, the bank subsequently redeemed these previously issued subordinated debt issuances as they would not have been considered as capital beginning january 1, 2014. the bank exercised the call option on its p8.5 billion 7.0%; p5.5 billion 7.75% and p4.5 billion 7.5% lower tier 2 notes on october 22, 2012, october 4, 2013 and may 6, 2014, respectively. the early redemptions of these instruments were in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes when they were originally issued. by redeeming the notes, the bank avoided a step-up in the interest rate and the capital decay from the instruments. in 2014, the bank raised a total of p22.5 billion in subordinated debt wherein p16.0 billion was issued on march 27, 2014 at a coupon rate of 5.375% and p6.5 billion on august 8, 2014 at 5.25%. the terms of the notes contain a loss absorption feature, allowing them to be recognized as bank capital in accordance with basel iii standards. the transactions were done in part to replace the basel ii tier 2 notes which were redeemed on their call option dates. as approved by the bsp on april 25, 2019, on june 27, 2019, the bank redeemed its 2024 peso notes amounting to p16.0 billion, ahead of its maturity. likewise, on august 8, 2020, the bank redeemed the 2025 peso notes amounting to p6.5 billion, ahead of its maturity after approval by the bsp on may 7, 2020.

as of december 31, 2020, the group’s capital adequacy ratio (car) and common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio are 20.15% and 19.28%, respectively, both well above the regulatory requirements.

2020 was a very challenging year for the global economy amid the triple shock brought by the covid-19 pandemic: a health crisis, strict lockdown measures, and a global recession of unprecedented scale. the philippines, along with most of the world’s economies, fell into recession, with the full-year 2020 gdp contraction coming in at -9.5%, a significant fall from the positive expansion of 6.0% in 2019. the sharp economic decline, especially in the second quarter of the year, was mainly attributed to the steep dive in household spending, deep slump in capital formation, and the collapse of external trade due to the impact of strict lockdown measures domestically and globally.
full-year average inflation came in slightly higher at 2.6% compared to 2.5% in 2019 amid the faster annual increases in some commodity groups towards the end of the year. the price of food, a heavily-weighted commodity, was higher in the last quarter of the year as weather-related disturbances adversely affected domestic supply conditions. nevertheless, the full-year average still came in within the bsp’s target range of 2-4%.
domestic interest rates remained low throughout 2020 on ample liquidity condition, benign inflation expectations, and subsequent policy rate cuts from the us federal reserve and the bsp. central banks in almost all of the countries adopted a loose monetary policy stance to support their own economies. the fed slashed the federal funds rate to near- zero in march and has been buying about $120 billion in government-backed debt every month. meanwhile the bsp cut key policy rates by a total of 200 basis points and deployed regulatory relief measures to complement fiscal stimulus and help stimulate the domestic economy.
risk appetite was the key driver of the usd well into the end of 2020. demand for the usd as a safe haven declined amid improving global market risk appetite especially for emerging market assets. the philippine peso made strong gains and remained within the p48 level from the p50.69 close at the start of the year. the peso was even hailed as asia’s best performing currency last year.
to overcome the adverse impact of the pandemic on the domestic economy, the government launched a socioeconomic strategy to address the covid-19 pandemic which included fiscal and monetary measures. on the fiscal side, the national government approved several stimulus packages aimed at helping the highly-vulnerable sectors. on the monetary side, the bsp slashed key policy rates by a total of 200 basis points and deployed regulatory relief measures to complement fiscal stimulus and help stimulate the economy.
the near-term outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain amid the renewed infection waves and new variants of the coronavirus. nevertheless, a likely softening in the 1st half of 2021 is seen to usher in a recovery in the 2nd half as the roll-out of vaccination programs in different countries gain pace. furthermore, the unprecedented policy support by governments is seen to continue and will become more targeted and flexible so as to adapt to fast- changing conditions.
for the philippine economy, support will still largely come from the national government and the bsp. a return of consumer confidence -- or the confidence of consumers to once again do both discretionary and non-discretionary spending -- will play a large role in the economic recovery because fundamentally, consumer spending is what drives the economic engines of the philippines.

to ensure that funds are more than adequate to meet its obligations, the bank proactively monitors its liquidity position daily. based on this system of monitoring, the bank does not anticipate having any cash flow or liquidity problem within the next twelve months. as of december 31, 2020, the contractual maturity profile shows that the bank has at its disposal about p1.192 trillion of cash inflows in the next twelve (12) months from its portfolio of cash, placements with banks, debt securities and receivable from customers. this will cover 76.29% of the p1.561 trillion total deposits that may mature during the same period. these cash inflows exclude securities booked in fvtpl and fvoci whose maturities beyond one (1) year but may easily be liquidated in an active secondary market. inclusive of these securities, the total current assets will cover 101.90% of the total deposits that may mature within one (1) year. on the other hand, historical balances of deposits showed that no substantial portion has been withdrawn in one year.

in the normal course of the group’s operations, there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. no material losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions.
several suits and claims relating to the group’s operations and labor-related cases remain unsettled. in the opinion of management, these suits and claims, if decided adversely, will not involve sums having a material effect on the group’s financial statements.

for the year 2020, the bank estimates to incur capital expenditures of about p3.0 to p5.0 billion, of which 70% is estimated to be incurred for information technology.
