the group’s results of operations are affected by a variety of factors. set out below is a discussion of the most significant factors that have affected its results in the past, and which the group expects, will continue to affect its results in the foreseeable future. factors other than those discussed below could also significantly impact the group’s results of operations and financial condition in the future.


the group’s results of operations are affected by consumers’ demand for its products, and pricing, in turn, affects demand. when determining its selling prices, the group considers various factors, including, among others, prices of raw materials and packaging materials, taxes, fuel prices and other costs of doing business, distribution channels, and general economic conditions. the group believes that instant noodles, bread, biscuits, and culinary aids are considered consumer staples. biscuits, beverages, and packaged cakes are less of a priority during a period of high inflation and restricted mobility. these products can be sensitive to movements in disposable incomes, changes in product prices, and competitive pressures. 2021 saw flat to declining demand for biscuits and beverages as these products are purchased for lunch boxes, between meals, and on-the-go consumption. restricted mobility affected some occasions for use of biscuits, beverages, and packaged cakes during the covid-19 pandemic.
demand for fast-moving consumer goods is price elastic in general, particularly for consumers in the lower socio- economic classes where disposable income is limited. when prices increase or during periods of relatively weak economic growth where disposable income falls, consumers tend to switch to comparable lower-priced staple products and cut back on their consumption of discretionary products, particularly those in the lower socio-economic classes. with inflation reaching a three-year high in 2021, breaching the bsp target, such effects may be more prone to drive consumer behavior if the high-inflation scenario persists.
in addition, demand for fast-moving consumer goods is also influenced by the relative price relationships between such goods, consumer products, and other products and services in general. consumers are prone to adjust their buying choices according to shifts in the perceived value-for-money propositions of the products. the group intends to continue to innovate its products to enhance the perceived product values.

the group’s future growth will depend on its ability to maintain the competitive positions of its product portfolios and brands by proactively anticipating and responding to constant changes in consumer tastes and preferences. a key element in maintaining the market share for the group’s product portfolios is the ability to continuously and successfully introduce new products and product extensions to capture prevailing consumer preferences.
consumer preferences may change due to various factors, including changes in economic conditions and income levels, shifts in demographic and social trends, changes in lifestyle and leisure activity patterns, regulatory actions and actions of competitors, any of which may affect consumers’ perception of and willingness to purchase the group’s products, which may significantly impact its results of operations.
the group regularly keeps abreast of the evolving consumer preferences and believes that its current broad array of products can address the shifts in trends. for example, to cater to a preference for a healthier product, the group adopted hsaf technology, infused its instant noodles with vegetable oil, and reduced palm oil in one of its lucky me! products. the group believes that quorn mycoprotein meat alternative products are well-placed to serve this segment for customers who demand food products that are more environment-friendly and offer health benefits. to take advantage of the “premiumization” trend of consumers, particularly from the growing rising middle class seeking higher quality and higher value products, the group expanded its mass premium segment (the segment between premium and mainstream price points) by launching instant noodles with asian flavors and instant pasta under the lucky me! brand and introducing monde specials as its mass premium packaged baked goods line offering high-quality baked products such as sponge cake, among other initiatives.

the effectiveness of the group’s sales and marketing activities is critical to its market share expansion and revenue growth. the group communicates with consumers through various channels and touchpoints, including advertisements on television, radio programs, social media platforms (such as youtube, facebook, instagram, and twitter), its website, program sponsorships, billboards, and brand activation roadshows. customer touchpoints at the purchase stage include in-store promotions and loyalty programs. in addition, the group partners with celebrities and other key influencers for media or online collaborations and events.
advertising affects consumer awareness of the group’s products and brands, which, in turn, affects purchase decisions and, consequently, sales volumes. the group believes that product differentiation and brand loyalty are achieved through its marketing and image-building efforts, and consumer brand preferences are the cumulative result of exposure to the brands over an extended period. however, the effects of these sales and marketing activities may be delayed. this results in delayed revenue growth, which may not be fully reflected during the period in which the sales and marketing activities took place.

direct materials are major components of the group’s cost of goods sold. direct materials comprise raw materials and packaging materials. raw materials primarily consist of wheat, palm oil, flour, sugar, and coconut oil. the group sources majority of raw materials and all of its packaging materials from both local and international third-party suppliers.
raw materials are subject to significant price volatility caused by a number of factors, including changes in global supply and demand, extreme weather conditions, size of harvests, transportation and storage costs, governmental agricultural policies, and currency exchange rate fluctuations. in addition, the group’s ability to obtain raw materials and packaging materials is affected by a number of factors beyond its control, including armed conflict, natural disasters, governmental laws and policies, interruptions in production by suppliers, and the availability of transportation.
the group’s profitability is dependent on, among other things, its ability to anticipate and react to fluctuations in the price of commodities, raw materials, and packaging materials. an increase in prices for or shortage of the group’s raw materials and packaging materials generally leads to an increase in production costs or interruption in the group’s production schedules, each of which could adversely affect its operating margins. production delays could lead to reduced sales volumes and profitability as well as loss of market share. conversely, favorable movements of raw materials costs and other items might improve the group’s margins and results of operations. the group has been able to mitigate price fluctuations in raw materials to some extent through a combination of (i) operational synergies, (ii) the use of long-term contracts with suppliers to lock in pricing, and the (iii) diversification of sources of supply.
given that a significant portion of the group’s flour requirement is produced in-house at its santa rosa facility, the group enjoys consistent supply, quality, and cost savings for flour from this operational synergy. operational synergy is also achieved in the supply of seasoning for instant noodles production, and the group set up a seasoning plant in thailand to produce seasoning and condiments for its noodle plants in the philippines.
increases in costs of raw materials and packaging materials can typically be passed on to consumers. however, this may affect consumer demand as the group’s consumers are generally price-sensitive. in some cases, these increases are not immediately passed on, if at all, to consumers in order to maintain or grow sales volumes and to protect the group’s market share. as a result, any material increase in the market price of raw materials could adversely affect the group’s operating margins, which may affect its financial position and operating performance.

the group has a diversified product mix which primarily includes instant noodles, biscuits, other fast-moving consumer products, and meat alternatives. the group adopts a multi-brand approach, where each product category
59
further consists of one or more brands or product lines. under each brand, the group offers products with different flavors, different package sizes and/or different types of products for variety. for example, in the instant noodles product group, there are three product lines under the lucky me! brand: (i) wet pouch; (ii) dry pouch; and (iii) cups. each lucky me! product line offers a wide array of flavors. in the meat alternative business, quorn has an extensive range of vegan and vegetarian, some of which are gluten-free. quorn products also cover all key shop aisles: frozen, chilled, and ambient products. the ability of the group to continuously develop new products and launch product extensions to capture various consumer preferences enables the group to successfully make available to its consumers a diverse and innovative product mix in a timely manner.
typically, different products vary in product pricing, revenue growth rate, and gross profit margin. each of the group’s brands has its own unique positioning with different marketing strategies and promotional costs. as a result, the group’s revenue and profitability are largely affected by its product mix.

the group’s products face competition from other domestic producers as well as from imported products and foreign brands. competitive factors facing the group’s products include price, product quality, availability, production efficiency, brand awareness and loyalty, distribution coverage, security of raw material supply, customer service, and the ability to respond effectively to changes in the regulatory environment as well as to shifting consumer tastes and preferences.
the group’s main competitors for the instant noodles product group are domestic producers which compete on pricing and regional brands that offer different flavors and taste experiences. the biscuits and other fast-moving consumer product groups face competition from multinational, national, regional, and local competitors. similar to the instant noodles product group, these players compete on pricing, taste, and innovation. the meat alternative business competes with a broad category of market participants such as multinational corporates, venture capital- backed newer entrants, and private labels, and the product group also competes with traditional meat brands. changes in the competitive landscape, including new entrants into the market, consolidation of existing competitors, and other factors, could have a material impact on the group’s financials and results of operations.

majority of the group’s assets and revenues from its apac bfb business are located in or derived from its business operations in the philippines. therefore, the group’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects are substantially influenced by the economic, social, and political conditions in the philippines, although the group is also significantly exposed to global commodity markets (mainly those for agricultural goods and energy). while the philippine economy has experienced stable growth in recent years prior to the covid-19 outbreak, the philippine economy has in the past experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, interest rates, fuel prices, power rates, other costs of doing business, and significant depreciation of the philippine peso. it has been significantly affected by weak economic conditions and volatilities in the global economy and the asia-pacific region. the covid- 19 pandemic, which led to nationwide and global restrictions and lockdown, has caused global and local economic recessions, and the philippine economy has been hard hit as a result. we expect the effects of the covid-19 pandemic to extend well into 2022, and recovery remains challenging. in addition, the russia-ukraine conflict and the attached impacts on the global markets will materially influence the group in areas such as commodity costs, supply constraints, and shipping. as consumers grapple with uncertainty, their buying behavior and preferences become more erratic. please see further discussion under “geopolitical situation in ukraine and russia,” outlining our management’s response to address challenges arising geopolitical situation in ukraine and russia.
sales of most of the products of the group’s apac bfb business have been influenced, and will continue to be influenced, to some degree, by the general state of the philippine economy as well as the stability of social and political conditions in the country, with 2022 being particularly impacted by the national elections. while sales of a portion of the group’s products such as biscuits, beverages, and packaged cakes can be sensitive to changes in income and social conditions such as restricted mobility, the group offers products that are considered as staple items or components to staple items which are less sensitive to income changes and adverse economic, social, and political conditions. these include instant noodles, bread, and culinary aids.
60
as the group also conducts its apac bfb business (including export operations) in thailand, economic, social, and political conditions in thailand may also affect the group’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. in addition, the covid-19 pandemic presented certain challenges in relation to the group’s interactions with its export distributors and assessment of the quality of in-market execution. with significant price increases in the shipping industry, availability of ships and containers and the resulting delays may influence the growth and profitability of the export business.
a significant portion of the group’s assets and revenue from its meat alternative business are also located in or derived from its operations in the uk. therefore, economic, social, and political conditions in the uk may also affect the group’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. the uk continues to be affected by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and extended recovery period, as well as the lingering effects of itsexit from the european union. labor shortages in the food and transport industry and significant commodity and utility inflation are present and may persist well into 2022. the uk presently posts material inflation numbers which have reached levels that have not been experienced in more than 25 years. this strong inflation footprint may impact the consumer buying behavior, and the company’s input costs

in the consumer goods industry, results of operations generally follow the seasonality of consumer buying patterns, and the group’s sales are affected accordingly. in the philippines, most food and beverage products, including those of the group, experience increased sales from october to december related to the christmas and new year’s season. consequently, the fourth quarter has historically been the group’s strongest quarter by volume for culinary aids and some of its biscuit products, including m.y. san grahams. seasonality during certain events also affects the group’s sales. in addition, seasonality varies across product types. some of the group’s products have distinct seasonality. for instance, lucky me! wet pouch instant noodles see an increase in sales in the colder months as customers’ preference for warm food increases. the government also sources instant noodles, a staple in its relief goods package, from the group for distribution to the public. a number of biscuit products experience higher sales during the school year as the group’s products are generally purchased for lunch boxes, between-meals, on-the-go consumption, and consumption at home. as a result, seasonality could affect the group’s financial condition and results of operations from one quarter to another, particularly in relation to the fourth quarter of each year. to counter the seasonality of some of its products, the group created marketing and advertising initiatives that encourage the sustained consumption of its products throughout the year. the group believes that the diversity of its product mix reduces the specific seasonality impact of certain products in its portfolio.

in addition to its ability to introduce new product innovations and renovations, delivering on the group’s aspiration will also depend on the group’s ability to continuously drive loss-eliminating process innovations and work system innovation. continuous improvement in process innovation and work system redesign will impact multiple fronts such as superior quality and consumer experience, fresher products to market, higher productivity, and improved sustainability via less wastage/use of resources and better process reliability.


at the early onset of the covid-19 pandemic in the philippines, the group faced the difficult task of ensuring the health and welfare of its employees while ensuring food supply especially noodles pouches and crackers, which are considered staples during tough times. the group adapted quickly, and both objectives were achieved without compromises. the group stayed in touch with the local communities, related industries, customers, suppliers, and people. the management team gathered daily to swiftly align decisions on the rapidly evolving situation. it also immediately deployed the infection control process in all of its facilities. overall, the group did not experience a material disruption in its production process and supply chain.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, when the covid-19 pandemic widely spread, there was flat to declining demand for biscuits, beverages, and packaged cakes. the group believes that this is due to these products being less of a priority during a period of weak economy. in addition, as biscuits and other snack-type products are generally purchased for lunch boxes and between-meals and on-the-go consumption, there were fewer occasions to use these
61
products while the general public was in lockdown and relied more on home cooking. the apac bfb group, however, saw a spike in sales volume of instant noodles and culinary aids, especially the oyster sauce, in the same period as these are perceived to be staple products. given that lucky me! is seen as comforting food and mama sita’s oyster sauce is a versatile product, the group believes that the public tends to resort to these products during tough times. during the covid-19 pandemic, the group prioritizes the safety of its employees and provides various support to ensure the well-being of its workforce. for example, the group, in coordination with the local government, has implemented free vaccination programs, installed sanitization equipment such as alcohol gel dispensers throughout its facilities, handed out masks, allowed employees to take special leaves, and provided isolation facilities for suspected cases. the group encourages employees to care for their health and implemented the “commit to covid- 19 free” program, which provides incentives to employees who do not contract covid-19 throughout the relevant period.

in february of 2022, an armed conflict between russia and ukraine commenced. as a result of this event, numerous sanctions were implemented against russia. both countries account for large parts of global agricultural supply, specifically, wheat, corn, and sunflower seeds and oil. furthermore, the two countries are key producers of other commodities such as oil and gas, related petrochemical products, and fertilizer, among others.
the armed conflict has put the 2022 growing season in ukraine at risk, and the export infrastructure inland and in the black sea inaccessible, severely damaged, or destroyed. possible effects may continue during the 2022-2023 growing season. such effects may be further amplified if weather conditions in other crop-growing regions of the world do not produce the necessary compensating output, impacting the already low stock-to-use ratios of most agricultural commodities globally.
the group is impacted by the accompanying world market price movements. thus, the sanctions imposed on russia may likely cause shortage in certain commodities, thereby resulting in increased prices for the said commodities. furthermore, shortage of supply in certain inputs arising from the conflict could impact the revenue and profitability of the group.
in light of the foregoing, the group is implementing measures to mitigate the identified risks above. such measures include, entering into supply contracts with longer terms, increasing inventory holding of key materials, and exploring diversification of sourcing regions for supply assurance. in parallel, some pricing considerations coupled with accelerated cost savings initiatives are underway to mitigate cost headwinds.

the ability of the group to meet the demand for its products depends on its ability to build, maintain, and expand its production capacity. capacity expansion affects the ability of the group to introduce new products or new uses for its existing products, which, in turn, impacts the ability of the group to be agile and responsive to rapidly changing customer needs and expectations.
capacity improvement and expansion require significant capital investment, including rapidly changing technologies and innovations. an investment in new technology or an enhancement of existing technology, in each case to increase capacity and utilization, may result in similar or other operational challenges. furthermore, the effects of these investments may be delayed, resulting in delayed revenue growth which may not be fully reflected during the period in which the investments were made.

the summary financial information presented below as at december 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the three years ended december 31, 2021 was derived from the group’s audited consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with philippine accounting standards. the information below is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations.

core income (after tax) at ownership pertains to core income (after tax) less core income attributable to non- controlling interest (nci).
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the attached audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of the group as at and for the year ended december 31, 2021.

as mentioned in the business overview section, the group’s two core businesses are the apac bfb business and the meat alternative business.
segment performance is evaluated based on: core earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, or core ebitda; core ebitda margin; and core income before tax, core income before margin, core income (after tax), core income (after tax) margin, core income (after tax) at ownership and core income (after tax) at ownership margin.

net sales continued to grow in a challenging environment, up by 2.0%, from ₱67,946 million in 2020 to ₱69,284 million in 2021, driven by the apac bfb segment and the favourable effect of foreign exchange (forex). growth was softened by volume decline in the meat alternative segment.

net sales in the apac bfb segment increased by 2.1%, from ₱52,911 million in 2020 to ₱54,039 million in 2021. the increase was primarily driven by high double-digit growth in the international sales, robust sales growth of noodles and culinary in the philippines, and the effect of price increase in q3 2021. high growth in international business was due to thailand and philippines export business even though sales were tapered by the shortage of shipping containers/vessels and port congestion. moreover, thailand's biscuits gained market share despite category decline primarily due to effective in-store execution and efficient promos. noodles was able to sustain a high level of sales in the philippines, grew low single-digit growth, despite volume upsurge last year. this was primarily driven by successful usage-building programs, proven strong relevance of the category, and price increase in q3 2021. culinary and cakes sales grew double-digit this year pushed by solid q4 performance, while biscuits and beverage full year decline was tapered by stronger q4 results. biscuits grew single digit in q4 primarily due to marketing push toward in-home consumption, mobility improvement, and price increase. beverage also saw an encouraging trend, as q4 sales grew high single-digit growth due to improvement in mobility and supply.


net sales in the meat alternative segment up by 1.4% from ₱15,035 million in 2020 to ₱15,245 million in 2021, driven by the positive effect of forex. excluding the effect of forex, meat alternative’s overall net sales growth was down by 3.9% due to volume decline across geographic markets. meat alternative sales were tapered by challenging macro- economic conditions in the uk and the effect of the covid-19 pandemic. effect of decline in retail segment was taperedbysolidperformanceinfoodservicesegment,q42021wasup69%andfullyearwasupby36.0%. further, carry-over price action in the uk and us helped soften the effect of volume decline.

cost of goods sold increased by 5.4%, from ₱41,440 million in 2020 to ₱43,693 million in 2021, primarily due to effect of rising commodity prices, higher utilities, repairs, and maintenance softened primarily by hedging and forward buying of wheat, palm, and edible oil. cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales slightly increased by 2.1%, from 61.0% in 2020 to 63.1% in 2021.

the cost of goods sold in the apac bfb segment increased by 7.8%, from ₱31,983 million in 2020 to ₱34,475 million in 2021, primarily due to rising commodity prices, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. prices of key raw materials and ingredients such wheat/flour, palm oil, coconut oil, and shortening liquid have increased significantly in 2021 as compared last year. the effect of rising commodity prices was partly softened by hedging, forward buying, continuing cost reduction initiatives in the supply chain. 2020 repairs were significantly low primarily due to the postponement of the planned repairs to focus more on the throughput. further, this year’s repairs include the purchase of various spare parts and the maintenance of the noodle lines.


the cost of goods sold in the meat alternative segment decreased by 2.5%, from ₱9,457 million in 2020 to ₱9,218 million in 2021, primarily due to the decline in volume across geographic markets and operational improvements partly offset by increasing energy cost which was more pronounced in q4.

gross profit decreased by 3.5%, from ₱26,506 million in 2020 to ₱25,591 million in 2021, for the reasons discussed above. the gross margin decreased by 2.1%, from 39.0% in 2020 to 36.9% in 2021.

gross profit for the apac bfb segment decreased by 6.5%, from ₱20,928 million in 2020 to ₱19,564 million in 2021, for the reasons discussed above. gross margin decreased by 3.4%, from 39.6% in 2020 to 36.2% in 2021.

gross profit for the meat alternative segment increased by 8.0%, from ₱5,578 million in 2020 to ₱6,027 million in 2021, for the reasons discussed above. the gross margin increased by 2.4%, from 37.1% in 2020 to 39.5% in 2021.

sales, general and administrative expenses (excluding non-recurring expenses) increased by 12.6%, from ₱13,409 million in 2020 to ₱15,095 million in 2021, primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotion expenses, a one-off credit in meat alternative due to fire insurance claims and a higher research and development expenses. the increase in advertising and promotion was primarily on brand building and consumer marketing activities. moreover, advertising and promotion’s year-on-year growth was higher partly due to the low base in apac bfb, as last year’s activities were postponed due to lockdowns.

sales, general and administrative expenses excluding non-recurring expenses in the apac bfb segment increased by 4.6%, from ₱9,462 million in 2020 to ₱9,897 million in 2021. as explained above, the increase was mainly due to normalization of spend on advertising and promotional expenses.

sales, general, and administrative expenses for the meat alternative segment increased by 31.7%, from ₱3,947 million in 2020 to ₱5,198 million in 2021. the increase was mainly due to brand building, consumer marketing, product development activities, and a one-off credit due to fire insurance claims received last q1 2020.


core income (after tax) decreased by 11.4%, from ₱9,380 million in 2020 to ₱8,315 million in 2021, for the reasons discussed above.

core income (after tax) at ownership decreased by 5.4%, from ₱8,655 million in 2020 to ₱8,185 million in 2021. core income attributable to non-controlling interest was significantly down by 82.1%, from =p725 million to =p130 million, due to acquisition by the parent company on january 29, 2021 of the minority shares of mmysc owned by mci.

the group reported a gain of ₱36 million in 2021, from a loss of ₱98 million in 2020. 2021 gain was mainly from kbt international holdings, inc. while the loss in 2020 was from smfc. the group started to consolidate smfc in september 2020 as the result of increased ownership from 25% to 80%. the group’s share in the losses of smfc went down to zero because of the effect of consolidating smfc’s operating results in 2021, which is now reflected in the group’s core income.

net foreign exchange gain decreased by 83.7%, from ₱914 million in 2020 to ₱149 million in 2021, primarily due to a higher 2020 base. last year’s foreign exchange gain was driven by the realization of gain on payment of us dollar and pound sterling-denominated loans because of the strengthening of the philippine peso against the us dollar and pound sterling and the unrealized foreign exchange gain on convertible notes, which was pegged at us$1: ₱52.186 while the philippine peso closing rate was us$1: ₱48.036.

miscellaneous income increased by 19.5%, from ₱246 million in 2020 to ₱294 million in 2021, due to reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment on advances due to effective collection efforts.

impairment loss decreased by 78.0% from
1,014 million in 2020 to
recognized were mainly from the meat alternative segment related to the underperforming reactor in its bf1 facility since it operated. this was softened by reversal of allowance in 2021 due to the improvement of the result of the operation of biscuit line in mnth. in 2020, impairment loss recognized were from the meat alternative segment related to the introduction of a new forming production line which involved a new production process but resulted in fermentation capacity that was significantly lower than expected, and higher operating costs. the production line is still in use but the carrying value has been adjusted accordingly, and the group expects that future capacity expansion
223 million in 2021. in 2021, impairment loss
projects will revert to established processes in the future.

interest expense flat by 0.3%, from ₱1,484 million in 2020 to ₱1,488 million in 2021. lower interest expense from bank loan was offset by recognition of cash variable interest amounting to ₱588 million. the cash variable interest is equal to the dividends received by the parent company’s shareholder, arran, that the latter would have received if the convertible note was converted into shares prior to the declaration of such dividend. the decrease in the interest expense from bank loans was due to the repayment of term loans. as at december 31, 2021, the group’s loan payable decreased by ₱22,547 million versus december 31, 2020, this was partly driven by the parent company’s early repayment of the outstanding term loans amounting ₱15,565 million as part of the change in use of ipo proceeds approved by the board of directors (“bod”) last august 9, 2021.

interest income decreased by 68.4%, from
263 million in 2020 to
83 million in 2021 mainly due to recognition of
gain on loan modification amounting to
₱
165 million in 2020. in 2020, the parent company and financial institutions
amended the fixed rate from 4.5% to 3.75% and extended the maturity from october 26, 2020 to october 26, 2023. this modification in the contractual cash flows was not substantial and therefore did not result in the derecognition
of the affected financial liabilities. as a result of this, the group recognized a gain.

the group recorded derivative losses of ₱2,258 million in 2021 compared to the derivative gains of ₱99 million in 2020. the derivative loss for 2021 was primarily due to the full settlement of arran’s convertible note last june 3, 2021, while the derivative gains pertain to the one-time gain due to the unwinding of the european union knockout option.

the group recognized additional ₱1,579 million losses in 2021 on top of the derivative loss due to redemption of arran’s convertible note on june 3, 2021.
the derivative loss and the loss on convertible note redemption are due to the difference between the carrying value of convertible note and related derivative liability as at june 3, 2021, redemption date, and the amount that the group paid upon redemption.

income before income tax decreased by 58.9%, from ₱11,725 million in 2020 to ₱4,825 million in 2021 due to the one-off loss related to the redemption of arran’s convertible note, ipo-related expenses, and others as discussed above.

income tax expense decreased by 56.8%, from ₱3,659 million in 2020 to ₱1,580 million in 2021, due to the lower income tax rate under the corporate recovery and tax incentives for enterprise (“create”) act from 30% to 25%, the recognition of the actual loss on redemption of the convertible note, and the reversal of previously recognized deferred tax liability related to the said note. the decrease was partly offset by the effect of the increase in deferred tax liability primarily in meat alternative. the uk tax rate was announced to increase from 19% to 25% by april 2023. as a result of the change in tax rate in uk, the group adjusted its deferred tax liability on its quorn and cauldron brand by ₱1,335.6 million to reflect the expected tax rate as at december 31, 2021. mnukl also reflected impact of the super capital allowance for qualifying capital expenditures as at december 31, 2021. in accordance with pas 12.46, income taxes, the current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to taxation authorities, using the rates/laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted as of the balance sheet date. the adjustment on
