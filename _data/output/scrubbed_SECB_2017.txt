the bank’s liquidity is adequate with a liquid-assets-to-total-assets ratio of 49.45% in 2017, 56.62% in 2016, and 53.51% in 2015. liquid assets consist of cash and other cash items, due from bsp, due from other banks, interbank loans receivable, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and investment securities at amortized cost. liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet funding obligations such as the repayment of liabilities or payment of asset purchases. liquidity risk is monitored and managed using the maximum cumulative outflows (mco) and funding diversification/ concentration limits. a contingency funding plan is likewise in place to ensure readiness for every liquidity crisis situation. the bank’s asset and liability committee (alco) is directly responsible for liquidity risk exposures. alco regularly monitors the bank’s positions and sets the appropriate fund transfer prices to effectively manage movement of funds across business activities. the bank does not anticipate any cash flow or liquidity problems within the next twelve months, and is not in default or breach of any note, loan, lease or other indebtedness or financing arrangement requiring it to make payments. all payables have been paid by the bank within the stated terms. there are no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the bank’s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.

the philippine economy is expected to exhibit robust expansion this year, with our forecast for gdp growth to nudge higher to 6.8% from last year’s 6.7%. strong domestic and external demand as well as solid production will fuel this year’s growth, which is seen to be one of the fastest in the asian region. we expect the domestic economy to be reinforced by government’s tax reforms and infrastructure program.
