for 2020, sales and margin improvements in the second half reduced overall decline with the group’s consolidated sales and operating income reaching p725,797 million and p71,476 million, 29% and 38% lower from the previous year, respectively. the decline in revenue was mainly caused by lower sales volume of petron corporation (petron) and the beer and non- alcoholic beverages (nab) division under the food and beverage business. this was due to lockdown and strict quarantine restrictions implemented by the government in the early part of the year coupled with lower selling price per liter of petron as a result of the volatility of global crude oil prices. sales of the energy business also declined due to the deferment of the power supply agreements with manila electric company (meralco) and lower contract rates under the new power supply agreements that took effect on december 26, 2019 compared to the previous agreements. the infrastructure business likewise registered a decline in sales which was mainly brought about by the decline in average daily traffic volume in all the operating toll roads which have been weighed down by the different levels of travel restrictions during the year.
cost of sales was lower by 30% to p576,449 million mainly due to the: (a) decrease in sales volume and lower cost per liter of petron, (b) lower power purchases, decline in net generation cost due to lower average cost of coal and natural gas prices, and lower energy fees due to the decline in net generation of the sual, ilijan and san roque power plants, and (c) lower sales volume from beer and nab and food divisions, under the food and beverage business. this was partly offset by the increase in sales volume of the spirits division.
the decrease in selling and administrative expenses by 9% to p77,872 million was mainly due to lower advertising and promotion, and freight, trucking and handling expenses primarily from the beer and nab and food divisions, under the food and beverage business, and reduction in outsourced services of petron due to the pandemic. advertising campaigns and promotions were suspended and reduced, respectively, due to covid-19 restrictions while the decline in freight, trucking and handling was brought about by lower sales volume.
the decrease in interest expense and other financing charges was mainly due to the: (a) lower average interest rate of petron and (b) lower interest expense of the energy business from the declining principal balance of its finance lease liabilities.
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates and average balance of cash and cash equivalents.
the increase in equity in net earnings was mainly due to the higher share in net income of manila north harbour port, inc. (mnhpi).
the higher loss on sale of property and equipment pertains to the retirement of the fixed assets of san miguel yamamura packaging corporation (smypc) manila plastics plant which were damaged by the fire incident in pandacan, manila in february 2020.
the increase in other income - net was mainly due to the: (a) settlement received by the energy business from third party contractors on account of damages arising from the latter’s nonfulfillment of obligations under procurement-related contracts and (b) income recognized by smc from the tax credit certificates (tcc) issued by the bureau of internal revenue (bir) in relation to the claims for refund filed for overpayment of excise taxes with the bir for san mig light.
the lower income tax expense was primarily due to the: (a) tax benefit by petron from the loss before tax in 2020 compared to tax expense on the income before tax last year, (b) lower taxable income of the beer and nab division under the food and beverage business and infrastructure business, and (c) derecognition by smc of deferred income tax asset on the net operating loss carry-over (nolco) which expired in 2019.
consolidated net income for the full year of 2020 amounted to p21,879 million, 55% lower than the same period in the previous year. consolidated net income in the second half amounted to p25,867 million, 15% higher than same period last year, reversing the first half net loss of p3,988 million, which was due largely to the economy’s contraction and quarantine restrictions. the improvement of the performance in the second half was mainly brought about by the sustained performance recoveries from all major businesses, combined with effective cost saving initiatives implemented throughout the group.
the share of non-controlling interests on the group's net income decreased in 2020 mainly due to the net loss of petron in 2020 as compared to a net income in 2019 and lower net income of the beer and nab division under the food and beverage business and atlantic aurum investments b.v. the decrease was offset by higher amount of distribution on smc global power holdings corp.’s (smc global) undated subordinated capital securities (uscs) and senior perpetual capital securities (spcs).

san miguel food and beverage, inc. (smfb) registered consolidated sales of p279,290 million for the full year, 10% lower than in 2019. its strong rebound in the second half narrowed its 19% decline in the first half, as a result of continuous volume improvements from its beer and nab division, the all-time high performance of its spirits division, and steady growth of the prepared and packaged food segment of the food division. this was, however, slightly tempered by lower volumes from the food division’s protein and animal nutrition and health segments.
smfb’s consolidated operating income ended at p33,412 million, a 30% decline, while net income closed at p22,401 million, down 31% from last year.

san miguel brewery inc. (smb) recorded consolidated sales of p107,928 million in 2020, 24% lower than in 2019. the decline was a direct effect of the enhanced community quarantine (ecq) restrictions throughout the country, as well as its regional markets. smb saw significant sales recovery in the second half of the year, posting a 52% sales improvement over the first half, delivering volumes of 202 million cases.
operating income amounted to p24,467 million, down 37%, and net income stood at p17,455 million.

domestic operations recorded robust volume growth in the first two months of the year, but quarantine lockdowns resulted to the closure of all on- and off- premise outlets, limited transport activities, and the banning of the sale of liquor products in many markets. all these took a toll on beer sales, particularly in the second quarter.
the easing of restrictions paved the way for the gradual, partial re-opening of the economy. as a result, performance began to pick-up in mid-may, with significant volume recovery in june, and sustained month-on-month sales improvements until year- end. sales for the year amounted to p97,828 million, buoyed by the price increase implemented on march 1, 2020, but remained 24% lower versus 2019. combined with cost containment efforts, operating income ended at p23,259 million.
smb boosted its presence in digital, e-premise, and other appropriate channels for sustained brand equity. it also tapped opportunities for selling especially in emerging and relevant channels, to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and adapt to the new normal. smb also put in place programs to further support the shift from on-premise to home consumption. effective cost management, rationalized spending, tighter business controls, and other cost saving initiatives were also implemented, helping sustain the domestic operations’ positive profit level.

to support recovery, smb strengthened its marketing campaigns with tv and radio placements namely, the “inom sweet home 5+1” promo and “pass the bottle” with the san miguel beermen. digital brand campaigns were also rolled out to supplement traditional media. for the first time, the yearly smb oktoberfest event was held virtually over facebook.

international operations were also affected by the pandemic, as governments in countries where there are operations implemented their own containment measures. this resulted to the temporary closure of manufacturing plants, as well as the closure of on-premise outlets, which resulted to a decline in consumption. the operations in indonesia and thailand were particularly affected, as on-premise consumption in these markets are relatively high.
meanwhile, the hong kong, south china, and vietnam markets were less affected, as evidenced by significantly improved profits compared to the previous year. the exports business also recorded consistent improvements, brought about by the continuous growth of off-trade channels and brand focused distribution.
smb international continues to implement its marketing programs, volume incentive initiatives, and market penetration and distribution activities, to sustain and improve volumes and profitability.

ginebra san miguel inc. (gsmi) started 2020 with healthy volume growth in the first two months of the year. volumes shrank during the ecq, but quickly recovered after. trade replenishments boosted sales, leading to june volumes reaching the highest monthly levels on record.
coming from a volume decline in the first half, gsmi’s sustained, strong month-on- month volume rebound resulted to full-year volumes of 38.6 million cases, up 8% from 2019. this is attributable to the expansion of distribution reach, continued efforts to maintain brand relevance, prompt replenishment of stocks in outlets, utilization of e- commerce channels via the san miguel online store “the mall”, and promotion through the online ginumanfest live concert.
in july, gsmi resumed its “lakas sa magandang bukas” and “i choose mojito” marketing campaigns on radio and television, as the economy reopened.
gsmi launched a new thematic campaign in september, “one ginebra nation 2.0”, sending out a message of hope, resiliency and unity, attuned to the call of this ongoing challenges which further helped bump up volumes. this was supported by localized consumer promos and the expansion of distribution coverage. another campaign, “gsm blue i choose mojito 2.0”, also contributed to volume increase.
consolidated sales for the full year reached p36,202 million, up 25% from the previous year’s p29,063 million.
with better operational efficiencies and effective alcohol sourcing, operating income amounted to p3,806 million, up 32% versus 2019. net income hit p2,757 million, 65% higher from 2019 - the highest ever recorded by gsmi.

the food division’s consolidated sales declined by 3% to p135,170 million, from the previous year, reflecting the full impact of ecq in its basic food segments which was partly moderated by the solid performance of the prepared and packaged food segment as packaged food became an essential item in consumers’ grocery baskets as they settled into their home-based- work-from-home and online classes lifestyle.
sales in the first three quarters followed a downward trend but slowly returned to growth as quarantine restrictions were eased in september. while institutional sales remained weak due to limited dine-in activities of food service, incremental sales from alternative trade channels partly offset this and the usual demand surge from christmas spending boosted revenues in the fourth quarter.
operating income dropped by 17% to p5,185 million in 2020 primarily due to the impact of the pandemic on revenues and operating expenses.
the protein segment, consisting of the magnolia chicken and monterey meats businesses, was most affected by the pandemic as revenues declined by 10%. many of the foodservice customers, including fast food chains and “lechon manok” outlets, were forced to close shop during the ecq. this resulted in a massive build- up of frozen chicken inventory in the second quarter, which pushed down prices. in response, aggressive move-out plans were implemented, such as developing alternative trade channels, notably community resellers, to push volumes and help bring down inventory. poultry volumes in the fourth quarter posted double-digit growth quarter-on-quarter, buoyed by a moderate uptick during the holiday season and incremental sales from alternative channels, particularly community resellers which accounted for 11% of total volumes in 2020. from 192 community resellers in march, it expanded to over 13,000 by end-december and this is still expanding. chicken prices likewise improved since october and reached around p125/kilo in december. meanwhile, the monterey meats business experienced lower revenues brought about by the restrictions on the movement of pork imposed by some local governments to combat african swine fever.
animal nutrition and health segment revenues registered a slight decrease of 2% due to the continuing effects of the african swine fever which affected hog feeds sales. proving to be a reliable supplier during the ecq and able to implement more competitive selling prices has allowed the business to grab market share. volumes ended slightly higher than the previous year, registering robust growth in free range fowl, duck and aquatic feeds, as customers opted for superior product quality produced in the new feed mills.
prepared and packaged food segment, composed of the processed meats, dairy, spreads, ice cream, biscuits and coffee businesses, posted 10% revenue growth as restricted living led to more in-home cooking and consumption. this pushed demand for breakfast items and benefitted the premium processed meats, margarine, cheese, and pancake mixes which all registered double-digit growth rates. our flagship product, purefoods tender juicy hotdog, saw volumes grow across all retail channels with our chicken variant - tender juicy chicken hotdog - registering the highest growth at 98% during the pandemic. purefoods hams and magnolia cheeseballs performed strongly in december as special christmas bundles were created so that more families could celebrate despite tight budgets.
changes in consumer behavior and increased demand for in-home food driven by lockdown restrictions, gave us opportunity to push our new products such as our 
ready-to-cook magnolia fried chicken, our newly-launched plant-based food products under the veega brand, the purefoods seafood line, and the purefoods heat and eat slow-cooked viands. new product launches also included ready-to-eat viands under the cook express and chef’s selections brands targeted at foodservice outlets and home-based businesses.
revenues of the flour segment were down by 2% mainly from a slowdown in volumes from institutional customers as well as lower selling prices. price rollbacks were made for hard flour due to aggressive competition in the industry. however, the retail sector continued to grow on the strength of increased demand for our bake best flour premixes and baking ingredients arising from heightened consumer interest in home baking.

the packaging business registered p31,504 million in sales for 2020, down 17% from the previous year, similarly reflecting the effects of the ecq. volumes were dragged down by lower orders from its major beverage customers. this was partly offset by increased deliveries to healthcare and pharmaceutical customers, growth in sales from the food and liquor sectors, mainly for home consumption due to the gradual re-opening of the economy and improvements in the export market. on the other hand, the performance of australia, malaysia, and china operations remained stable.
with effective cost management initiatives, the packaging business generated operating income of p961 million.

smc global registered full year sales of p115,029 million, 15% lower versus 2019, as off- take volumes of 26,116 gigawatt hours (gwh) declined by 7%. this was primarily due to the deferment of commencement of the 290 megawatts (mw) mid-merit power supply agreement with meralco, where the provisional approval of the energy regulatory commission (erc) was posted and distributed to the parties only on march 16, 2020 and the deferment of the 260 mw extended contract with masinloc, which remains pending erc approval to-date.
in addition, the new meralco baseload power supply agreements that took effect on december 26, 2019 have lower contract rates compared to the previous power supply agreements.
sales volumes were affected by a decline in demand from industrial and contestable customers during the lockdown period, which gradually improved with the reopening of economic activities after the easing of the ecq restrictions. this was, however, mitigated by improved utility demand as household consumption increased.
with lower fuel costs and spot purchases and effective implementation of power dispatch strategies, operating income ended 3% higher at p36,923 million. net income, on the other hand, amounted to p18,874 million, 31% higher than last year.
smc global also increased its total capacity during the year. on september 26, 2020, it officially started commercial operations of its masinloc unit 3, with 335 mw capacity. on december 15, 2020, it achieved substantial completion, which included the testing and commissioning by the national grid corporation of the philippines, of its 20 mwh battery energy storage (bess) facility in kabankalan, negros occidental.
with this, smc global’s total capacity reached 4,697 mw as of december 31, 2020, accounting for 20% of the national grid, 27% of the luzon grid, and 8% of the mindanao grid.
it has also started to undertake the expansion of its portfolio of bess projects that will provide an additional 1,000 mwh. the initial 490 mwh across 15 sites are in advanced stages of completion and are expected to start operating in early 2021. the remaining 510 mwh across other sites are expected to be completed by the early part of 2022.

petron face significant challenges throughout the year. global oil prices, which had already been volatile, plunged in march as a price war broke among the top oil producing countries. dubai crude collapsed by around 33%, from an average of $63.5 per barrel in 2019 to $42 per barrel in 2020, resulting to successive rollbacks in pump prices.
oil prices fell to as low as us$13/bbl in daily trading, reaching record low levels in 26 years. refining margins also remained weak in the region as oil consumption declined. demand for fuel also fell as transportation and mobility were severely restricted throughout the ecq period.
petron posted successive recoveries in the last two quarters of the year, resulting in net profit of p2,823 million in the second half, as world crude prices stabilized and rallied towards year-end, bringing subsequent inventory gains. consolidated volumes also improved, from the second quarter slump. still, these were not enough to compensate for losses incurred in the first half, which resulted from demand contraction in both domestic and international markets, poor refining margins, and the collapse in world oil prices.
as a result, petron’s consolidated sales amounted to p286,033 million, down 44% from the previous year. volumes were likewise down 27% to 78.6 million barrels. petron recorded consolidated operating loss of p4,629 million and net loss of p11,413 million in 2020.
petron continues to implement measure to maximize productivity and reduce expenses in order to cope with the pandemic’s impacts. cash preservation initiatives are in place, as petron continues to find new ways to adapt, given that the economy’s recovery may take longer than initially expected.

the infrastructure business recorded a 33% volume drop for 2020, reflecting the effect of travel restrictions throughout luzon. despite this, the business continued to waive toll fees to help to medical front liners. following the easing of restrictions, a significant recovery in traffic volumes was seen, with some operating toll roads registering daily traffic at almost pre-pandemic levels.
combined average vehicle daily traffic in the fourth quarter reached 80% of 2019 levels, with notable recoveries from the south luzon expressway (slex) and star tollway.
as a result, full year sales amounted to p14,565 million, 38% lower than the previous year, while operating income ended 78% lower at p2,571 million.
the infrastructure business, nevertheless, delivered on its commitments and completed two major projects. the entire stretch of the tarlac-pangasinan-la union expressway (tplex) from tarlac up to rosario, la union was completed and opened to the public. the construction of the skyway stage 3 project, linking slex and north luzon expressway (nlex) was also completed. skyway stage 3 was soft-opened december 29, 2020, and was inaugurated and opened to motorists on january 14, 2021.
the metro rail transit (mrt 7) project is progressing well, with construction returning to normal levels. work on sections from quezon memorial circle to quirino highway traversing commonwealth avenue and regalado avenue is ongoing.
construction of the slex toll road 4 (slex tr4) project, which will extend slex from sto. tomas, batangas to lucena city in quezon province is ongoing along the alaminos- tiaong area. coordination with the dpwh is also ongoing to expedite the acquisition of right-of-way.
meanwhile, the alabang south skyway extension project is in an advanced stage of completion. the construction on skyway stage 4 has also started at workable areas along c-5. acquisition of right-of-way properties is ongoing. the toll regulatory board has given the group permission to proceed with detailed engineering design on realignments.
stages 1 and 2 of the bulacan bulk water treatment facilities are now complete. feasibility study of stage 3 has also been completed, while work on the preliminary engineering design is ongoing.

consolidated total assets as at december 31, 2020 amounted to about p1,912,207 million, p94,473 million or 5% higher than december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to the higher balance of cash and cash equivalents, property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, offset by the decrease in inventories and trade and other receivables.
the increase in cash and cash equivalents by p60,752 million was mainly due to the: (a) net proceeds from the issuance by smc of us$1,950 million long-term corporate notes and preferred shares (smc2j preferred shares and smc2k preferred shares), and (b) issuance by smc and smc global of us$500 million and us$1,350 million spcs, respectively. the increase was reduced by the: (c) funding of the various capital expenditures of the group, (d) payment of long-term debt and short-term loans of the group, and (e) redemption of preferred shares (smcp1 preferred shares and smc2d preferred shares) by smc.
the decrease in trade and other receivables by p12,119 million was mainly due to lower trade customer balances by petron attributable to lower fuel prices and drop in sales volume.


the decrease in inventories by p24,641 million was attributable mainly to lower prices and volume of both crude and finished products of petron philippines and petron malaysia.
the decrease in total biological assets by p1,206 million was mainly due to the closure of some farms affected by the african swine fever.
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets by p8,025 million was primarily due to: (a) higher specific tax and product replenishment claims and unused creditable withholding taxes by petron, (b) increase in input taxes by upsi related to the importations of equipment for the bess projects, and (c) receipt by smc of tcc issued by the bir in relation to the claims for refund filed for overpayment of excise taxes with the bir for san mig light.
the increase in property, plant and equipment by p48,010 million was mainly due to the: (a) on- going projects of the energy business, the food division, and the beer and nab division, and (b) various fixed asset purchases by petron.
the increase in investment property by p8,899 million was mainly due to the: (a) acquisition of land in pandacan, manila by smhc, (b) acquisition of land for the airport project, and (c) various properties acquired by smpi.
the increase in other intangible assets by p20,518 million was mainly due to the costs of various projects of the infrastructure business, net of amortization during the year, and the mineral rights recognized upon consolidation of ncc.
