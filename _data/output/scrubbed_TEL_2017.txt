our payment for purchase of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, in 2016 totaled php42,825 million, a decrease of php350 million, or 1%, as compared with php43,175 million in 2015, primarily due to pldt’s lower capital spending, partially offset by smart group’s higher capital spending. smart group’s capital spending, increased by php1,782 million, or 6%, to php32,089 million in 2016 from php30,307 million in 2015, primarily focused on expanding 3g and lte (4g) coverage and reach, as well as capacity and service enhancements. pldt’s capital spending decreased by php3,201 million, or 28%, to php8,058 million in 2016 from php11,259 million in 2015. the capex spending was used to finance the continuous facility roll-out and expansion of our domestic fiber optic network, cable fortification and resiliency, and acquisition of new platforms to complement introduction of new products and services, as well as expansion of our data center business. the balance represented other subsidiaries’ capital spending.
as part of our growth strategy, we may from time to time, continue to make acquisitions and investments in companies or businesses.

on a consolidated basis, cash flows used in financing activities amounted to php40,319 million in 2017, an increase of php24,978 million, or 163%, from php15,341 million in 2016, resulting largely from the combined effects of the following: (1) higher payments of long-term debt and interest by php19,549 million and php564 million, respectively; (2) lower proceeds from availment of long-term debt by php14,314 million (3) higher net settlement of capital expenditures under long-term financing by php1,695 million; (4) higher collections from derivatives by php759 million; (5) proceeds from issuance of perpetual notes of php4,165 million in 2017; and (6) lower cash dividend payments by php6,370 million.

proceeds from availment of long-term debt for the year ended december 31, 2017 amounted to php26,255 million, mainly from pldt’s drawings related to the financing of our capital expenditure requirements and refinancing of maturing loan obligations. payments of principal and interest on our total debt amounted to php39,199 million and php7,076 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017.
proceeds from availment of long-term debt for the year ended december 31, 2016 amounted to php40,569 million, mainly from pldt’s drawings related to the financing of our capital expenditure requirements and refinancing maturing loan obligations. payments of principal and interest on our total debt amounted to php19,650 million and php6,512 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016.
our consolidated long-term debt decreased by php12,421 million, or 7%, to php172,611 million as at december 31, 2017 from php185,032 million as at december 31, 2016, primarily due to debt amortizations and prepayments, partly offset by drawings from our long-term facilities and the depreciation of the philippine peso relative to the u.s. dollar. as at december 31, 2017, the long-term debt level of of smart decreased by 17% to php62,388 million from php74,851 as at december 31, 2016, while pldt’s increased to php110,223 million from php109,867 million as at december 31, 2016. dmpi loans, with a balance of php314 million as at december 31, 2016, have been fully paid as at december 31, 2017.

our consolidated debt instruments contain restrictive covenants, including covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and other financial tests, calculated in conformity with pfrs, at relevant measurement dates, principally at the end of each quarterly period. we have complied with all of our maintenance financial ratios as required under our loan covenants and other debt instruments.

as at december 31, 2017 and 2016, we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

we believe that our available cash, including cash flow from operations, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our projected operating, investment, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next 12 months; however, we may finance a portion of these costs from external sources if we consider it prudent to do so.

none of our existing indebtedness contains provisions under which credit rating downgrades would trigger a default, changes in applicable interest rates or other similar terms and conditions.

on january 16, 2017, moody’s affirmed pldt’s foreign currency bond rating and local currency issuer rating at “baa2”. both ratings are considered “investment grade.” the outlook in both ratings is stable.
on may 24, 2017, s&p affirmed our long-term foreign issuer credit rating at “bbb+”, with a stable outlook. this rating is considered as “investment grade.” on the s&p asean regional scale, pldt’s rating affirmed at “axa+”.
on december 12, 2017, fitch upgraded pldt’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating at “bbb+”, with a stable outlook. fitch also affirmed pldt’s long-term local currency issuer default rating at “bbb+” and its national rating at “aaa (phl)”, both with a stable outlook.

our total assets amounted to php459,444 million as at december 31, 2017, a decrease of php15,675 million, or 3%, from php475,119 million as at december 31, 2016, primarily due to lower property and equipment, investments in associates and joint ventures, mainly resulting from the sale of the remaining beacon shares to mpic, and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by higher trade and other receivables, and advances and other noncurrent assets.

our total liabilities amounted to php348,261 million as at december 31, 2017, a decrease of php18,321 million, or 5%, from php366,582 million as at december 31, 2016 significantly due to lower interest-bearing financial liabilities of php172,611 million as at december 31, 2017 from php185,032 million as at december 31, 2016.

there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have any current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders’ equity, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

on august 5, 2014, the pldt board of directors approved the amendment of our dividend policy, increasing the dividend payout rate to 75% from 70% of our core earnings per share as regular dividends. in 2016, in view of our elevated capital expenditures to support the build-out of a resilient and reliable data network, lower ebitda primarily due to higher subsidies to grow the data business and defend market share and the resources required to support the acquisition of smc’s telecommunications business, we have lowered our regular dividend payout to 60% of our core income. in declaring dividends, we take into consideration the interest of our shareholders, as well as our working capital, capital expenditures and debt servicing requirements. the retention of earnings may be necessary to meet the funding requirements of our business expansion and development programs. however, in the event that no investment opportunities arise, we may consider the option of returning additional cash to our shareholders in the form of special dividends of up to the balance of our core earnings or to undertake share buybacks. we were able to pay out approximately 100% of our core earnings for seven consecutive years from 2007 to 2013, approximately 90% of our core earnings for 2014, 75% of our core earnings for 2015 and 60% of our core earnings in 2016 and 2017. the accumulated equity in the net earnings of our subsidiaries, which form part of our retained earnings, are not available for distribution unless realized in the form of dividends from such subsidiaries. dividends are generally paid in philippine pesos. in the case of shareholders residing outside the philippines, pldt’s transfer agent in manila, philippines, as the dividend-disbursing agent, converts the philippine peso dividends into u.s. dollars at the prevailing exchange rates and remits the dollar dividends abroad, net of any applicable withholding tax.
our subsidiaries pay dividends subject to the requirements of applicable laws and regulations and availability of unrestricted retained earnings, without any restriction imposed by the terms of contractual agreements. notwithstanding the foregoing, the subsidiaries of pldt may, at any time, declare and pay such dividends depending upon the results of operations and future projects and plans, the respective subsidiary’s earnings, cash flow, financial condition, capital investment requirements and other factors.
consolidated cash dividend payments paid to shareholders amounted to php16,617, php22,987 million and php32,532 million as at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

our outstanding consolidated commercial commitments, in the form of letters of credit, amounted to php88 million and php6,788 million as at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. these commitments will expire within one year. the commercial commitment in 2016 includes standby letters of credit issued in relation with pldt’s acquisition of vti, bow arken and brightshare.

the main risks arising from our financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. the importance of managing those risks has significantly increased in light of the considerable change and volatility in both the philippine and international financial markets. our board of directors reviews and approves policies for managing each of these risks. we also monitor the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.

inflation can be a significant factor in the philippine economy, and we are continually seeking ways to minimize its impact. the average inflation rate in the philippines for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were 3.2% and 1.8%, respectively. moving forward, we currently expect inflation to rise following the impact of the implementation of the tax reform acceleration and inclusion law which may push inflation higher in the upper end of the 2% to 4% target range according to the bsp.

the rapid change of technology and proliferation of ott services, also known as voip services (such as facebook, skype, viber, whatsapp and other similar services), have disrupted our business. due to the adoption of new technologies, changing customer habits, and the growing popularity of these new ott services, our traditional revenue sources, such as sms, voice and international calling services, have declined, and we expect this trend to continue.
growing mobile data usage in the philippines, coupled with the prevalence of ott services have negatively impacted our domestic calling service in recent years. ott services continue to increasingly compete with us in voice and data services and continue to affect our business model. we are also facing growing competition from providers offering services using alternative wireless technologies and ip-based networks, including efforts by the philippine government to roll-out its free wifi services to various municipalities in the country. moreover, net settlement payments between pldt and other foreign telecommunications carriers for origination and termination of international call traffic between the philippines and other countries, which have been our predominant source of foreign currency revenues, have been declining in recent years.
our capital costs could increase as we phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and invest in new ones. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. we can neither assure you that we would be able to adopt or successfully implement new technologies and services nor assure you that future technological changes will not adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

increasing competition among existing telecommunications services providers, as well as competition from new competitors, could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects by, among other factors, forcing us to lower our tariffs, reducing or reversing the growth of our customer base and reducing usage of our services. competition in the mobile telecommunications industry is particularly intense, with network coverage, quality of service, product offerings, and price dictating subscriber preference, while competition in the fixed line side is beginning to escalate as well. vital capacity and coverage expansion may continue to increase our capital expenditures. recently, operators have grown more aggressive in maintaining and growing market share, especially in light of a maturing market. our principal mobile competitor, globe, has introduced aggressive marketing campaigns and promotions, such as unlimited voice, sms, and data offers. it has also expressed interest to compete more actively in the fixed line segment, and has started to offer fixed line products and services.
in 2017, the philippine government announced its intentions to introduce in the philippines telecommunications market a third major company. the process for the establishment of this third major player is currently underway, and is heavily supported by the philippines government. media reports indicate that established international telecommunications companies are part of the shortlist. a third major player will likely adversely threaten our market share. furthermore we believe that the third player, when it enters the market, may put forth aggressive offers to lure customers away from us and globe. to maintain our competitive posture, we may need to match those offers and offer other incentives to prevent existing customers from switching. a loss of market share and increased costs to maintain our competitive posture will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to the entry of a third major player, we cannot assure you that the number of providers of telecommunications services will not increase in the future or that competition for customers will not cause our mobile and fixed line subscribers to switch to other operators, or otherwise cause us to increase our marketing expenditures, lose customers or reduce our rates, resulting in a reduction in our profitability.
our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, network coverage, quality of service, price, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

we have entered into a number of outsourcing agreements with technology vendors covering key operations in order to improve efficiencies and maximize knowledge transfer. these arrangements may disrupt existing operations and result in resistance among employees. furthermore, any delays in implementation or failure to bring about the desired results will hamper our ability to meet our medium-term targets.
in particular, as part of our extensive capital expenditures program to overhaul our fixed and wireless networks infrastructure and our it systems, we have entered into agreements with amdocs and huawei to upgrade and modernize a significant portion of our it infrastructure. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accomplish this transformation in a timely fashion, or at all, or in the manner intended. furthermore, we cannot guarantee that such transformation will not result in service disruptions, network outages or encounter other issues that may detrimentally affect consumer experience. this may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business relies heavily as well on third party vendors, some of whom may encounter financial difficulties or consolidate with other vendors. this may result in shrinking the already limited pool of qualified vendors which in turn may materially impact their ability to fulfill their obligations and thereby impact our operations.

the majority of our total revenues are currently derived from the provision of mobile services to customers in the philippines. as a result, we depend on the continued development and growth of this industry in the philippines. the mobile penetration rate in the country, however, has already reached approximately 118% as at december 31, 2017, and thus the industry may well be considered mature. further growth of the market depends on many factors beyond our control, including the continued introduction of new and enhanced mobile devices, the price levels of mobile handsets, consumer tastes and preferences, and the amount of disposable income of existing and potential subscribers. any economic, technological or other developments resulting in a reduction in demand for mobile services or otherwise causing the philippine mobile telecommunications industry to stop growing or reducing the rate of its growth, could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

section 11, article xii of the 1987 philippine constitution provides that no franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the philippines or to corporations of associations organized under the laws of the philippines, at least 60% of whose capital is owned by such citizens. exceeding the foreign ownership restrictions imposed under the philippine constitution may subject the company to (1) sanctions set out in section 14 of the philippine foreign investments act of 1991, as amended, comprising a fine not exceeding (a) the lower of (x) 0.5% of the total paid in capital of the company and (y) php5 million, in the case of a corporate entity, (b) php200,000, in the case of the president of the company or other responsible officers, and (c) php100,000, in the case of other natural persons, which we refer to collectively as the monetary sanctions, and/or (2) the philippine government commencing a quo warranto case in the name of the republic of the philippines against the company to revoke the company’s franchise that permits the company to engage in telecommunications activities.
we believe that as of the date of this report, pldt is in compliance with the requirements of the constitution, and this position was recently supported by the supreme court; however, we cannot assure you that subsequent changes in law or additional litigation would not result in a different conclusion. see item 3. “legal proceedings” and note 27 – provisions and contingencies – in the matter of the wilson gamboa case and jose m. roy iii petition to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in item 7. “financial statements” for further discussion.

we operate our business under franchises, each of which is subject to amendment, termination or repeal by the philippine congress, and to various provisional authorities and cpcns, which have been granted by the ntc and will expire between now and 2028. some of our cpcns and provisional authorities have already expired. although we have filed applications for extension of these cpcns and provisional authorities, we cannot assure you that the ntc will grant the applications for renewal. failure to renew cpcns can materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct the essential functions of our business, and therefore adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. see item 1. “description of business – licenses and regulations” for more information.

the philippine congress may revoke, or the solicitor general of the philippines may file a case against smart and dmpi to revoke, the franchise of smart and dmpi for their failure to comply with r.a. 7925, which requires making a public offering of at least 30% of the aggregate common shares of a telecommunications entity with regulated types of
services. see item 4. “information on the company – material effects of regulation on our business” for further discussion.
on may 19, 2017, republic act no. 10926 took effect which extended the legislative franchise of smart. the law contains a provision which exempts smart from the requirement of listing of shares if a grantee is wholly owned by a publicly listed company with at least thirty per centum (30%) of whose authorized capital stock is publicly listed. thus, smart is in compliance with ra 7925.
we cannot assure you that any of our franchise, permits or licenses will not be revoked and any such revocation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or prospects.

the ntc regulates the rates we are permitted to charge for services that have not yet been deregulated, such as local exchange services. we cannot assure you that the ntc will not impose additional obligations on us that could lead to the revocation of our licenses if not adhered to and/or to the reduction in our total revenues or profitability. the ntc could adopt changes to the regulations or implement additional guidelines governing our interconnection with other telecommunications companies or the rates and terms upon which we provide services to our customers. the occurrence of any of these changes could materially reduce our revenues and profitability.
the pldt group is also subject to a number of national and local taxes. we cannot assure you that the pldt group will not be subject to new, increased and/or additional taxes and that the pldt group would be able to impose or pass on additional charges or fees on its customers to compensate for the imposition of such taxes or charges, or for the loss of fees and/or charges.
moreover, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to anti-competitive practices and anti-monopoly. the philippine competition act came into effect on august 8, 2015 and prohibits practices that restrict market competition through anti- competitive agreements and abuse of a dominant position. it also requires parties to provide notification and obtain clearance for certain mergers and acquisitions. the philippine competition act prescribes administrative and criminal penalties for violations of these prohibitions. while our business practices have not in the past been found to have violated any laws and regulations related to anti-competition and anti-monopoly, we cannot assure you that any new or existing governmental regulators will not, in the future, find our business practices to have an anti-competitive effect on the philippines telecommunications industry, nor can we assure you that we will not be found to have violated the relevant laws and regulations relating to anti-competition and anti-monopoly in the future.
in particular, pldt was engaged in litigation with the philippine competition commission, or the pcc, relating to pldt’s investments in vti, bow arken and brightshare, or the smc transactions. although the court of appeals, or ca, among other things, compelled the pcc to recognize that the smc transactions as deemed approved by operation of law, the ca did clarify the that the deemed approved status of the smc transactions does not, however, remove the power of pcc to conduct post-acquisition review to ensure that no anti-competitive conduct is committed by the parties. any future expansion in our services, particularly in our mobile services, could subject us to additional conditions in the granting of our provisional authorities by the ntc and to increased regulatory scrutiny, which could harm our reputation and business, and which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and prospects. in addition, the occurrence of any such event could impose substantial costs or cause interruptions or considerable delays in the provision, development or expansion of our services.

legislation such as r.a. 10173 (data privacy act of 2012) and its implementing rules and regulations aim to protect individual privacy. the rules apply to the processing of personal data in the private sector, as well as to acts done or practices engaged in and outside of the philippines under certain conditions. likewise, ntc issuances under mc 05-07- 2016 deals with the rights of the subscriber on record as to the data supplied by him and ntc mc no. 05-06-2007 deals with call data records and under what circumstances could they be obtained. the regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection laws in the philippines is unsettled.
any failure, or perceived failure, by us to make effective modifications to our policies, or to comply with any privacy, data- retention or data-protection-related laws, regulations, orders or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, a loss of user confidence, damage to the pldt brands, and a loss of users or advertising partners, any of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
in addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data-retention and data-protection issues, including laws or regulations mandating disclosure to domestic or international law enforcement bodies, which could adversely impact our business, our brand or our reputation with users. the interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data retention laws and regulations are often uncertain and in flux. these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices, complicating long-range business planning decisions. if privacy, data protection or data retention laws are interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current policies and practices we may be fined or ordered to change our business practices in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results. complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices or operating platforms in a manner adverse to our business.

we possess a substantial amount of personal information of our customers. in the event an information leak occurs, we might be subjected to penalties under the data privacy law, our credibility and corporate image may be significantly damaged, and we may experience an increase in cancellations of customer contracts and slower increase in additional subscriptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

regulators have been increasing their focus on online and mobile payment services, and recent regulatory and other developments could reduce the convenience or utility of our payment services for users. governmental regulation of certain aspects of mobile payments systems under which pldt operates could result in obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products that we may offer to consumers, the payment card systems that link to our mobile payments systems, the jurisdictions in which our payment services or apps may be used, and higher costs, such as fees charged by banks to process funds through our mobile payments systems. such obligations and restrictions could be further increased as more jurisdictions regulate payment systems. moreover, if this regulation is used to provide resources or preferential treatment or protection to selected payments and processing providers, it could displace us from, or prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies.

the available radio frequency spectrum is one of the principal limitations on a wireless network’s capacity, and there are limitations in the spectrum and facilities available to us to provide our services. our future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative video products and data services and a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations. improvements in our service depend on many factors, including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum.
our competitiveness may decline if we cannot obtain the necessary or optimal allocation of spectrum from the philippine government. if the philippine government does not fairly allocate spectrum to wireless providers in general, revoke spectrum previously granted to us, or if we cannot acquire needed spectrum or deploy the services customers desire on a timely basis without burdensome conditions or at adequate cost while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers, and therefore maintain and improve our operating margins, could be materially adversely affected.

if a sufficient number of mobile service providers do not adopt the technologies and the frequency bands that are compatible with ours, if mobile service providers switch to other technologies or frequency bands, or if there is a delay in the introduction and expansion of compatible technologies and frequency bands, we may not be able to offer international roaming or other international services as expected, which may adversely affect our business.

as growth slows or reverses in our traditional fixed line and mobile businesses, and as part of our strategy to grow other business segments, we make acquisitions and investments in companies or businesses to enter new businesses or defend our existing markets. the success of our acquisitions and investments depends on a number of factors, such as:
our ability to identify suitable opportunities for investment or acquisition;
our ability to reach an acquisition or investment agreement on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all;
the extent to which we are able to influence or exercise control over the acquired company;
the compatibility of the economic, business or other strategic objectives and goals of the acquired company with those of the pldt group, as well as the ability to execute the identified strategies in order to generate fair returns on the investment; and
our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company or business with our existing businesses.
any of our contemplated acquisitions and investments may not be consummated due to reasons or factors beyond our control. even if any contemplated acquisitions and investments are consummated, we may not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and investments and we cannot assure you that the consummation of such acquisitions and investments will not result in losses for a prolonged period of time. moreover, if we are unsuccessful in our contemplated acquisitions and investments, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy to maintain or grow certain of our businesses and our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.

given the nature of our business and our foray into the digital business, we have made investments in various start-up companies. for example, in 2014, we invested in rocket internet se (formerly rocket internet ag), or rocket, to drive the development of online and mobile payment solutions, the fair value of which has declined significantly since our investment. due to the significant decline in fair value of our investment in rocket internet, we recognized a series of impairments that amount to, in the aggregate, php11,045 million, since then. see item 5. “operating and financial review and prospects – critical accounting policies” and note 11 – available-for-sale financial investments – investment of pldt online in rocket internet to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in item 7. “financial statements” for more information. credit ratings and market values of this investment and similar investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, foreign exchange rates, or other factors. as a result, our investments could decline and result in a material impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.


our business requires the regular installation of new, and the maintenance of existing, telecommunications transmission and other facilities and equipment, which are being undertaken. the installation and maintenance of these facilities and equipment are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, such as:
shortages of equipment, materials and labor;
delays in issuance of national and local government building permits;
work stoppages and labor disputes;
interruptions resulting from man-made events (e.g., sabotage), inclement weather and other natural disasters;
rapid technological obsolescence
inability of vendors to deliver on commitments
unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems; and
unanticipated cost increases.
any of these factors could give rise to delays or cost overruns in the installation of new facilities or equipment or could prevent us from deploying our networks and properly maintaining the equipment used in our networks, and hence could affect our ability to maintain existing services and roll-out new services, for example, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

the effects of, and any damage caused by, exposure to an electromagnetic field remain the subject of careful evaluations by the international scientific community. we cannot rule out that exposure to electromagnetic fields or other emissions originating from mobile handsets will not be identified as a health risk in the future. our mobile business may be harmed as a result of any future alleged, or actual, health risk or the perception of any health risk, which could result in a lower number of customers, reduced usage per customer or even potential consumer liability.

our business operations rely on us securely maintaining our network infrastructure and computer systems. a cyber-attack on our systems could cause service disruptions, damage to our systems and infrastructure, including damage to our physical assets, malfunction of our technology or services, accidental and/or deliberate misuse of our systems and other assets, alteration of our technology, publication of our proprietary technologies, methods, processes, business strategies and other confidential information, as well as unauthorized access to confidential information about our customers, including their financial information, any of which may lead to reputational harm, loss of confidence in our brand, litigation, regulatory actions and loss in customers, each of which, individually or in the aggregate may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in order to minimize our exposure to cyber security risks, we have deployed a multi-layered defense mechanism from the network to the host and up to the application level. however, we can neither assure you that any of such defenses will be effective against or neutralize the effects of any cyber incidents resulting from unintentional cyber security breaches or deliberate attacks on our network infrastructure or computer systems, nor assure you that our business will not be significantly disrupted in the event of such security breach or attack. if we fail to timely and effectively prevent the occurrence of any new or existing cyber security incidents, or fail to promptly rectify any such incidents, our business could be significantly disrupted, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the confidence of our stakeholders could be lost.

theft of telecommunication cables, major equipment failures or natural disasters, including severe weather, terrorist acts or other similar or related contingencies could adversely affect our wireline and wireless networks, including telephone switching offices, microwave links, third-party-owned local and long-distance networks on which we rely, our cell sites or other equipment, our customer account support and information systems, or employee and business records, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

our projects under development and the continued maintenance and improvement of our networks and services, including smart’s projects, networks, platforms and services, require substantial ongoing capital investment. our consolidated capital expenditures totaled php40,299 million, php42,825 million and php43,175 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we currently estimate that our consolidated capital expenditures in 2018 will be approximately php58 billion.
future strategic initiatives could require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures. we may be required to finance a portion of our future capital expenditures from external financing sources, some of which have not yet been fully arranged. there can be no assurance that financing for new projects will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. if we cannot complete our development programs or other capital projects on time due to our failure to obtain the required financing, our growth, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

a substantial portion of our capital expenditures, a portion of our indebtedness and related interest expense and a portion of our operating expenses are denominated in u.s. dollars and other foreign currencies, whereas most of our revenues are denominated in philippine pesos. see note 21 – interest-bearing financial liabilities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in item 7. “financial statements”.
a depreciation of the philippine peso against the u.s. dollar would increase the amount of our u.s. dollar-denominated debt obligations, capital expenditures, and operating and interest expenses in philippine peso terms. in the event that the philippine peso depreciates against the u.s. dollar, we may be unable to generate enough funds through operations and other means to offset the resulting increase in our obligations in philippine peso terms. moreover, a depreciation of the philippine peso against the u.s. dollar may result in our recognition of significant foreign exchange losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. a depreciation of the philippine peso could also cause us not to be in compliance with the financial covenants imposed on us by our lenders under certain loan agreements and other indebtedness. further, fluctuations in the philippine peso value and of interest rates impact the mark-to-market gains/losses of certain of our financial debt instruments, which were designated as non-hedged items.
the philippine peso has been subject to significant depreciation in recent years with the philippine peso depreciated by approximately 21% from a high of php41.08 for year end 2012 to php49.96 as at december 31, 2017 and further depreciated to php52.29 as at march 26, 2018. we cannot assure you that the philippine peso will not depreciate further
and be subject to significant fluctuations going forward, due to a range of factors, including:
political and economic developments affecting the philippines, including the level of remittances from overseas filipino workers;
global economic and financial trends;
the volatility of emerging market currencies;
any interest rate increases by the federal reserve bank of the united states and/or the bsp; and
higher demand for u.s. dollars by both banks and domestic businesses to service their maturing u.s. dollar obligations or foreign exchange traders including banks covering their short u.s. dollar positions, among others.

our existing debt instruments contain covenants which, among other things, require pldt to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial tests, calculated on the basis of ifrs at relevant measurement dates, principally at the end of each quarter period. for a description of some of these covenants, see note 21 – interest-bearing financial liabilities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in item 7. “financial statements”.
our indebtedness and the requirements and limitations imposed by our debt covenants could have important consequences. for example, we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements.
the principal factors that could negatively affect our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants and other financial tests under our debt instruments are depreciation of the philippine peso relative to the u.s. dollar, poor operating performance of pldt and our consolidated subsidiaries, impairment or similar charges in respect of investments or other long-lived assets that may be recognized by pldt and its consolidated subsidiaries, and increases in our interest expenses. of our total consolidated debts, approximately 20% and 31% were denominated in u.s. dollars as at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. considering our consolidated hedges and u.s. dollar cash balances allocated for debt, the unhedged portion of the consolidated debt amounts were approximately 8% in each of december 31, 2017 and 2016, and therefore these financial ratios and other tests are expected to be negatively affected by any weakening of the philippine peso relative to the u.s. dollar.
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our debt covenants, we may need to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. an inability to effect these measures successfully could result in a declaration of default and an acceleration of maturities of some or all of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

a significant part of our total revenues and cash flows from operations are derived from our subsidiaries, particularly smart. smart has significant internal cash requirements for debt service, capital expenditures and operating expenses and as a result, may be financially unable to pay any dividends to pldt. although smart has been making dividend payments to pldt regularly since december 2002, there can be no assurance that pldt will continue to receive these dividends or other distributions, or otherwise be able to derive liquidity from smart or any other subsidiary or investee in the future.
creditors of our subsidiaries generally have priority claims over our subsidiaries’ assets and cash flows. we and our creditors will effectively be subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of our subsidiaries, except that we may be recognized as a creditor with respect to loans we have made to subsidiaries. if we are recognized as a creditor of a subsidiary, our claim will still be subordinated to any indebtedness secured by assets of the subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary otherwise deemed superior to the indebtedness we hold.
we may have difficulty meeting our debt payment obligations if we do not continue to receive cash dividends from our subsidiaries and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected as a result.

as at january 31, 2018, the first pacific group and its philippine affiliates, ntt communications and ntt docomo, and jg summit holdings, inc. and its affiliates, or jg summit group, collectively, beneficially own approximately 53.93% in pldt’s outstanding common stock (representing 31.83% of our overall voting stock). see item 7. “major shareholders and related party transactions” for further details regarding the shareholdings of ntt communications and ntt docomo in pldt, and the rights granted pursuant to the cooperation agreement, strategic agreement and the shareholders agreement.
additionally, all of pldt’s shares of voting preferred stock, which represent approximately 41% of pldt’s total outstanding shares of voting stock are owned by a single stockholder, btf holdings, inc., or btfhi.
the fp parties and/or ntt communications and/or ntt docomo and/or jg summit group and/or btfhi may exercise their respective voting rights over certain decisions and transactions in a manner that could be contrary to the interests of other shareholders or stakeholders in pldt.

we are required to comply with various philippine and u.s. laws and regulations on internal control. however, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including our failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, our reputation, financial condition and results of operations, and the market prices of our common shares and adss could decline significantly.

as at december 31, 2017, pldt has three employee unions, representing in the aggregate 5,328, or 30%, of the employees of the pldt group. this unionized workforce could result in demands that may increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. for instance, pldt experienced a significant charge from its manpower rightsizing program in 2017, mainly incurred in the fixed-line business. see note 5 – income and expenses – compensation and employee benefits to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in item 7. “financial statements”. each of our different employee groups may require separate collective bargaining agreements. if any group of our employees and pldt are unable to reach agreement on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business.
additionally, in 2017, pldt received a compliance order from the department of labor and employment of the philippines, or dole, on july 3, 2017 in connection with the non-payment of statutorily required monetary benefits, including the 13th month salary, to certain contract workers. the compliance order held the pldt group liable for php78.6 million. we cannot guarantee that pldt or its subsidiaries will not be subject to similar proceedings or other labor-related regulatory activities, the results of which may have an adverse reputational and/or financial impact. see note 27 – provisions and contingencies to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in item 7. “financial statements”.

our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified key technical, development, sales, services and management personnel. the loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be costly and time consuming, could cause additional disruptions to our business, and could be unsuccessful. we cannot guarantee the continued employment of any of the members of our senior leadership team, who may depart our company for any number of reasons, such as other business opportunities, differing views on our strategic direction or other personal reasons. any inability to attract, retain or motivate our personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects.

we are currently involved in various legal proceedings. our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims have been developed in consultation with our counsel handling the defense in these matters and is based upon our analysis of potential results. our future financial performance could be materially affected by an adverse outcome or by changes in our estimates or effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings and assessments.

for more information on pldt’s legal proceedings, see item 3. “legal proceedings” and note 27 – provisions and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item 7. “financial statements.” while pldt believes the positions it has taken in these cases are legally valid, the final results of these cases may prove to be different from its expectations. in addition, there is no assurance that pldt will not be involved in future litigation or other disputes, the results of which may materially and adversely impact its business and financial conditions.

the philippines is subject to political, social and economic volatility that, directly or indirectly, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to sustain our business and growth.
the philippines, china and several southeast asian nations have been engaged in a series of long-standing territorial disputes over certain islands in the west philippine sea, also known as the south china sea. should these territorial disputes continue or escalate further, the philippines and its economy may be disrupted and our operations could be adversely affected as a result. in particular, further disputes between the philippines and china may lead both countries to impose trade restrictions on the other’s imports. any such impact from these disputes could adversely affect the philippine economy, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and financial performance.
we cannot assure you that the political environment in the philippines will be stable or that the current or any future government will adopt economic policies that are conducive to sustained economic growth or which do not materially and adversely impact the current regulatory environment for the telecommunications and other companies.

the philippine government has, in the past, instituted restrictions on the conversion of the philippine peso into foreign currencies and the use of foreign exchange received by philippine companies to pay foreign currency-denominated obligations. the monetary board of the bsp has statutory authority, with the approval of the president of the philippines, during a foreign exchange crisis or in times of national emergency, to:
suspend temporarily or restrict sales of foreign exchange;
require licensing of foreign exchange transactions; or
require the delivery of foreign exchange to the bsp or its designee banks.
we cannot assure you that foreign exchange controls will not be imposed in the future. if imposed, these restrictions could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain foreign currency to service our foreign currency obligations.

as a foreign private issuer incorporated in the philippines and listed on the pse, we are permitted under applicable nyse rules to follow certain home country corporate governance practices. the corporate governance practice and requirements in the philippines do not require us to have a majority of the members of our board of directors to be independent, and do not require regularly scheduled executive sessions of non-management directors or regularly scheduled executive sessions where only independent directors are present. further, the criteria for independence of directors and audit committee members applicable in the philippines differ from those applicable under the nyse rules. these philippine home country corporate governance practices may afford less protection to holders of our adss.

historically, the philippines’ sovereign debt has been rated non-investment grade by international credit rating agencies. in december 2017, the philippines’ long-term foreign currency-denominated debt was affirmed by fitch as investment-grade with a rating of bbb+ with a stable outlook, and standard and poor’s and moody’s affirmed the philippines’ long-term foreign currency-denominated debt to the investment-grade rating of bbb+ and baa2, respectively, with a stable outlook. though investment grade, the relatively low sovereign rating of the philippine government will directly and adversely affect companies domiciled in the philippines as international credit rating agencies issue credit ratings by reference to that of the sovereign. no assurance can be given that fitch, moody’s, s&p or any other international credit rating agency will not downgrade the credit ratings of the philippine government in the future and, therefore, philippine companies, including pldt. any such downgrade could have a material adverse impact on the liquidity in the philippine financial markets, the ability of the philippine government and philippine companies, including pldt, to raise additional financing, and the interest rates and other commercial terms at which such additional financing is available.
