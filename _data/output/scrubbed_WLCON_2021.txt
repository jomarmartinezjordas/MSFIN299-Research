the company recorded net income of ₱2,561 million for the year 2021, up by 76.8% or ₱1,113 million from the ₱1,449 million reported in 2020 with net margins of 9.3% and 6.4%, respectively. the increase was mainly driven by the hike in net sales and the expansion in the gross profit margin partly offset by the increase in operating expenses and income tax expense.

net sales for the year 2021, amounted to ₱27,513 million, an increase of 21.6% or ₱4,884 million from last year. the increase was driven by comparable sales, which grew by 12.1% traced mainly to the increase in the number of transactions particularly in branches located in luzon.
in march 2020, at the outset of the pandemic, all luzon branches were closed for two months in compliance with the quarantine rules imposed by the philippine government to control the spread of the covid-19 disease. in 2021, except for sporadic one-day closure of a few stores in view of typhoons or localized pandemic-related lockdowns, all branches remained operational throughout the year despite surges in covid-19 cases and imposition of stricter quarantine measures. all stores remained open when stricter quarantine measures were imposed particularly in metro manila, nearby provinces and bigger cities in visayas and mindanao from the last week of march until the end of april and from august to mid-october.
the balance of the increase was contributed by below one-year sales of new stores. the company opened ten (10) new branches in 2021, nine (9) depot format stores and one (1) smaller format, home essentials.
on a per format basis, sales from the depot-format stores, which comprised 97.4% of total net sales, grew by 22.1% or ₱4,851 million to ₱26,792 million from the ₱21,941 million net sales in 2020. comparable sales growth (same store sales growth) reached 12.3%, contributing 91.9% of the total net sales increase of the format. meanwhile, sales from new depots comprised 8.1% of the format’s net sales growth.

gross profit grew by 32.0% or ₱2,494 million from the 2020 level of ₱7,782 million to close at ₱10,276 million for the year for a gross profit margin of 37.3%. the increase was traced mainly to higher sales for the period and the expansion in gross profit margin which grew by 296 basis points year-on-year. the improvement in gross profit margin is traced mainly to changes in product mix within the exclusive and in-house brands classification, which resulted in a higher overall margin for the class, partly offset by the drop in their contribution to total net sales to 49.5% from 50.9% in the same period in 2020.

operating expenses increased to ₱6,732 million for the year, up 17.3% or ₱994 million from the prior year’s ₱5,738 million. the increase is attributable mainly to expansion-related expenses particularly in salaries, trucking, utilities, outsourced services, depreciation and amortization partially offset by the decrease in donations. non-pfrs 16 related rent expense increased by 25.9% or ₱30 million to ₱147 million mainly due to lease term changes and increase in the variable component of the leases.

interest expense increased by 9.6% or ₱41 million, to total ₱470 million for the year from the prior year’s ₱429 million, attributable to added leases for new stores. all interest expense represents non- cash interest charged on lease liability recognized for the period in relation to the adoption by the company of pfrs 16 on leases.

other income (charges) for the year ended december 31, 2021 amounted to ₱351 million, decreased by 19.4% or ₱85 million from prior year’s ₱435 million. other income consists of:
1) rent concession in 2020 from lessors related to leases of land and buildings resulted in the reduction in lease liabilities that was recognized in profit or loss amounting to ₱101 million upon applying the practical expedient of pfrs 16;
2) interest income of ₱29 million, which decreased from the prior period balance of ₱55 million as investible funds particularly from ipo proceeds continued to be deployed for store network expansion. the ipo proceeds were fully utilized as at december 31, 2021;
3) rent income of ₱61 million, rose by 42.6% or ₱18 million year-on-year in view of new contracts and the continued collection of rent as all branches remained open through all the quarantine phases imposed during the year; and
4) net other income from trade and other suppliers amounting to ₱259 million, up by 9.5% or ₱22.6 million from 2020. net other income is comprised of share of various operational and promotional/marketing expenses of suppliers and other non-merchandise sales related income.

the company’s income tax expense increased by 43.6% or ₱262 million to end at ₱863 million in 2021 from the ₱601 million incurred during the same period last year. the increase is attributed to:
1) higher taxable income in 2021 partly offset by the lower income tax rate of 25% from the previous 30%;
2) a one-time recognition of a net tax expense as a result of the downward adjustment in the deferred tax asset balance as of december 31, 2020 to reflect the decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 30% to 25% approved in march 2021 but retroactive from july 1, 2020.
