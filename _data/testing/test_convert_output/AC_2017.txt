AC ENERGY HOLDINGS, INC. 

Overview 

Ayala operates its power generation business through AC Energy Holdings, Inc. (alternatively referred 
to as “AC Energy” or “ACEHI”), which was established in 2005 as its vehicle for its investments in the 
power sector. AC Energy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ayala. AC Energy continues to pursue green 
field,  as  well  as  currently  operating,  power  related  projects  for  both  renewable  and  conventional 
technologies  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  From  2011  to  2016,  it  invested  approximately  US$800 
million in the power sector to build and acquire over 1,000MW of attributable generating capacity as of 
31 December 2017. AC Energy intends to double its attributable generating capacity to over 2,000MW 
by 2020. 

Projects 

AC Energy has entered into several joint ventures to develop power projects across various sites in the 
Philippines. These include: 

Solar 

In 2015, AC Energy signed a Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreement with BCE, the investment arm 
of  Bronzeoak,  for  the  development,  construction  and  operation  of  a  solar  power  farm  in  Bais  City, 
Negros Oriental. This project is owned and operated by Monte Solar Energy Inc., a special purpose 
company. The first phase of the project is for an 18MW solar power plant with a total project cost of 
P=1.3 billion which was completed in February 2016, and is currently dispatching its full capacity to 
partially meet the energy requirements of Dumaguete City and Cebu City. The second phase is for the 
expansion of the initial 18MW solar power plant to up to 50MW. 

Wind 

In March 2011, AC Energy acquired a 50% effective stake in NorthWind. NorthWind owns and operates 
the 52-MW wind farm located in Bangui Bay, Ilocos Norte. The wind farm has 20 wind turbines and is 
the first commercial wind farm ever established in Southeast Asia. 

AC  Energy  acquired  an  additional  17.8%  stake  in  NorthWind  in  2016.  This  increased  AC  Energy’s 
effective ownership interest from 50 percent to 67.8 percent. 

In July 2013, AC Energy signed an Investment Framework Agreement and Shareholders’ Agreement 
with  UPC  Philippines  Wind  Holdco  I  B.V.,  a  wholly-owned  company  of  UPC  Renewable  Partners 
(“UPC”)  and  the  Philippine  Investment  Alliance  for  Infrastructure  (“PINAI”)  fund,  comprised  of  the 
Government  Service  Insurance  System,  Langoer  Investments  Holding  B.V.  and  Macquarie 
Infrastructure Holdings (Philippines) Pte. Limited. Under the agreements, the parties agreed to develop 
wind  farm  projects  in  Ilocos  Norte  through  Northern  Luzon  UPC  Asia  Corp.  as  their  joint  venture 
company (now named North Luzon Renewable Energy Corp. or “NLR”). An initial equity investment 
has been agreed for the first 81MW Caparispisan wind farm project, which has a total project cost of 
approximately US$220 million. AC Energy funded 64% of the project’s equity, with PINAI funding 32% 
and UPC funding 4%. 

In April 2015, AC Energy’s wind farms in Bangui and Caparispisan, Ilocos Norte received their Feed-
in-Tariff Certificate of Compliance or “FIT COC” from the Energy Regulatory Commission. These entitle 
NorthWind’s  19MW  wind  farm  expansion  in  Bangui,  and  NLR’s  81MW  wind  farm  in  Caparispisan, 
Pagudpud  under  NLR  to  a  feed-in-tariff  (“FIT”)  of  PHP8.53  per  kilowatt  hour  for  a  period  of  twenty 
years. The FIT rate covers the period October 2014 to October 2034 for NorthWind’s 19MW expansion 
and November 2014 to November 2034 for NLR’s 81MW wind farm. 

In September 2015, AC Energy sold a portion of its ownership stake in NLR. Subsequent to such sale, 
AC Energy remains the single largest indirect shareholder in NLR with a 25.73% stake. 

Thermal 

SLTEC 

In June 2011, AC Energy signed a joint venture agreement with Phinma Corp.’s Trans-Asia Oil and 
Energy Development Corporation (now PHINMA Energy Corp. or “PHINMA”) to form the 50/50 joint 

S E C   F O R M   1 7 - A  

77 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
venture  company,  SLTEC.  The  joint  venture  is  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  2x135-MW 
Circulating  Fluidised  Bed  thermal  power  plant  in  Calaca,  Batangas.  SLTEC  achieved  commercial 
operations for the first unit of the Calaca project in 2015 and for the second unit in 2016. Also in 2016, 
AC Energy and PHINMA sold of a portion of their ownership stake in SLTEC to Marubeni Corporation’s 
subsidiary, Axia Power. The sale brought PHINMA’s ownership in SLTEC to 45%, and AC Energy’s 
ownership to 35%. 

GNPower Mariveles 

In December 2012, Ayala entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire the interests held by 
an affiliate of a fund advised by Denham Capital in GN Power, the owner and operator of the 2 X 300 
MW  coal-fired  generating  plant  in  Mariveles,  Bataan  province.  In  January  2014,  Ayala,  through  its 
wholly-owned subsidiary, AIHL, closed the acquisition of approximately 17% interest in GN Power. The 
acquisition  includes  a  step-up  in  the  sharing  percentage  (economic)  attributable  to  the  limited 
partnership interest acquired from approximately 17% to approximately 20% (following a pre-agreed 
formula) upon the recoupment by Sithe Global Investors (the lead partner for the project) of their total 
equity contribution to the project. In the second half of 2017, the step up of Ayala’s sharing percentage 
to  approximately  20%  became  effective.  In  January  2018,  the  restructuring  of  Ayala’s  ownership  of 
GNPower Mariveles was completed with the transfer by AIHL’s affiliate of its direct interest in GNPower 
Mariveles  to  ACE  Mariveles  Power  Ltd.  Co.,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  AC  Energy.      The  other 
sponsors of the Mariveles power plant are power project developer Power Partners Ltd. Co. and Sithe 
Global Power LLC, which is now owned and controlled by Aboitiz Power Corp. 

GNPower Kauswagan 

In addition, AC Energy signed in July 2013 a partnership agreement with Power Partners Ltd. Co., a 
private limited partnership engaged in developing and owning power facilities in the Philippines since 
2001, to build and operate a 3 x 135 MW thermal power plant in Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte through 
GNPower Kauswagan Ltd Co. (“GNPK”). The project was subsequently expanded to include a fourth 
unit, and PINAI participated as an additional limited partner in GNPK. 

In July 2016, GNPK achieved financial close for the additional funding to enable the construction of the 
fourth unit of the Kauswagan coal power plant, at a total estimated project cost of US$1.0 billion. The 
plant is expected to start commercial operations by the second quarter of 2019.  

GNPower Dinginin 

In  December  2013,  AC  Energy  signed  an  Investment  Agreement  with  Sithe  Global  GNPD  BV  and 
Power Partners Ltd. Co. for the development of a proposed 2 x 668 MW coal power plant project in 
Bataan.  In  January  2017,  GNPower  Dinginin  Ltd.  Co.,  the  joint  venture  company  of  the  partners, 
commenced construction of the plant, with Unit 1 targeted for completion by 2019 and Unit 2 targeted 
for completion by 2020. 

International 

AC Energy has started to establish a footprint overseas. 

In  January  2017,  AC  Energy  invested  in  the  development  of  a  75MW  wind  farm  in  Sidrap,  South 
Sulawesi, Indonesia. The Sidrap project is targeted for completion by the first quarter of 2018, and will 
be the first utility-scale wind farm project in Indonesia. The Sidrap project is the first greenfield offshore 
investment of AC Energy, through its affiliate, AC Energy International Holdings Pte Ltd., a Singapore 
private limited company. 

In April 2017, AC Energy, as part of an Indonesian consortium, completed the purchase and acquisition 
of Chevron’s geothermal assets and operations in Indonesia. The consortium consists of AC Energy 
(with a 19.8% economic stake), the Star Energy Group and EGCO. The acquisition was made through 
a joint venture company, Star Energy Geothermal (Salak-Darajat) B.V. The assets include the Darajat 
and Salak geothermal fields in West Java, Indonesia with a combined capacity of 637MW of steam and 
power. 

In July 2017, AC Energy and Star Energy entered into definitive agreements for the transfer of 99% of 
their consortium interests in ACEHI-STAR Holdings, Inc. to AllFirst Equity Holdings, Inc. ACEHI-STAR 
Holdings, Inc. is the special purpose company that signed a share sale and purchase agreement with 
Chevron  in  December  2016  to  acquire  Chevron’s  Philippine  geothermal  assets,  subject  to  the

satisfaction  of  certain  conditions  precedent,  including  the  approval  of  the  Philippine  Competition 
Commission. 

With the Chevron and Sidrap investments, AC Energy tripled its renewables portfolio to over 260MW. 

In  July  2017,  AC  Energy,  acting  through  its  subsidiary  AC  Energy  International  Holdings  Pte  Ltd., 
entered into a shareholders’ agreement with UPC Renewables Asia Pacific Holdings Limited and UPC 
Renewables Asia I Limited to provide development funding to certain island renewable power projects 
in Indonesia. 

Renewable energy development platform 

In March 2017, AC Energy acquired 100% ownership of BCE (now Visayas Renewables Corp.) and 
SCCE  (now  AC  Energy  DevCo  Inc.).  The  acquisition  provides  AC  Energy  a  renewable  energy 
development, management and operations platform. The platform currently provides operations and 
management  support  to  renewable  energy  companies  that  include  San  Carlos  Solar  Energy  Inc., 
Negros Island Solar Energy Inc., Monte Solar Energy Inc., San Carlos BioPower Inc., South Negros 
BioPower Inc. and North Negros BioPower Inc. 

Environmental 

While AC Energy continues to tap conventional energy sources to help secure energy availability in the 
Philippines, AC Energy is firmly committed to exploring innovations in power. To keep environmental 
impact at a minimum, AC Energy’s conventional coal fired plants use the best available technologies 
and management approaches to reduce the accumulation of fly ash, and air and coal dust emissions. 
Meanwhile,  SLTEC,  which  uses  atmospheric  fluidized  bed  combustion,  has  an  approximate  8% 
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions per MW electricity produced compared with conventional coal 
fired power plants. 

AC INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS INC. - AUTOMOTIVE 

AC Industrials or the Group’s Automotive unit has minority investments in automobile manufacturing 
and assembly companies consisting of a 12.9% interest in HCPI and a 15% interest in IPC. HCPI is a
